Contracting Activig: Department of the Navy, Military Sealiﬂ Command (MSC). 2. Description of the Action Being Approved: Award of a ﬁlm—ﬁxed price contract on a sole source basis for Cargo Refrigeration Operator (OP) Controls System replacement in support of the MSC T—AKE class vessels. Trident Maritime Systems is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the system and no other supplier can provide replacement system without signiﬁcant re- engineering and high risk to the Government, 3. Description of Supplies/Services: MSC requires OEM parts and services to support the upgrade and replacement of the Cargo Refrigeration 0P Controls System stations installed aboard MSC T» AKE class vessels, The upgrade will provide MSC with better reliability and availability of parts and provide for an avenue to complete future in place upgrades without replacing equipment. Trident Maritime Systems will provide all installation and logistics support required to install these upgrades onboard all 14 T-AKE class vessels. This will include procurement of all hardware/software, shipping of all hardware to the installation locations, removal/modiﬁcation of the existing hardware, installation of the hardware/software and testing of the system. The action executed under this J&A has an estimated value of _ as outlined below inclusive of all options. Funding is currently available for ﬂiis work and will utilize Navy Working Capital Funds (NWCF), 4. Statutorv Authoritv Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is 10 U,S.C. 2304(c)(l) as prescribed by FAR 63 02-1, \"Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.\" 5. Rationale Justifving Use of Cited Statutorv Authority: Trident Maritime Systems is the OEM for the Cargo Refrigeration OP Controls System installed on MSC T—AKE class vessels The Cargo Refrigeration OP Controls are the overarching mechanism for environmental control of cargo holds 3&4 and the pre-stage boxes, This equipment is a criticality level 3 and is needed to conduct vessel mission, This action covers the replacement of the control system hardware and human machine interfaces while maintaining existing Trident Maritime Systems proprietary software algorithms and input output relationships In addition, this control system provides commands to Trident Maritime Systems Cargo Refrigeration Equipment. Procuring alternative replacement parts will compromise the required reliability and effectiveness of the system installed on T-AKE vessels. Any work performed by any company other than the OEM would jeopardize the Cargo Refrigeration Operator J&A Control Number: N104—l 9-R—4600 Controls System and put the vessel’s mission at unnecessary risk. Due to the Cargo Reefer being mission essential equipment, Trident Maritime Systems must maintain conﬁguration management and oversight of this critical equipment to ensure safe and effective operation. Award to any other source other than the OEM would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. 6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Manv Potential Sources as Prach’cable: IAW FAR S.201(b)(1)(i), the Government intends to issue a synopsis and solicitation on FEDBIZOPPS for the procurement, with the intent of awarding a firm ﬁxed price contract. The synopsis will act as a notice of intent to award a contract on an other than full and open competition basis and will not be a request for competitive proposals. However, all sources will be asked to submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to provide requested items or any exception to the intent to purchase under a sole source basis. As stated below MSC posted a sources sought with only one response from the OEM. 7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost: The Contracting Ofﬁcer will determine the contract prices to be fair and reasonable using price analysis techniques described in FAR 15,404-1, 8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition: For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, MSC has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the types ofparts/services covered by this document, and there are no actions planned to remove or overcome the brand name requirement. If another potential source emerges, MSC will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. 9. Description of Market Research Conducted: A sources sought (SS) notice was posted on the FEDBIZOPPS website on 09 September 2018 and closed on 26 September 2018, The SS respondents were requested of capability to provide the required parts/services or alternative solutions that are compatible with the Cargo Reefer Operator Controls System; as well as, the commerciality of the system. One (1) response was received from Trident Maritime Systems clarifying they were able to provide the required parts/services for the Cargo Reefer Operator Controls System; as well as, verifying the new design would contain commercial components To date, there has been no indication of changes in the market for providing parts/services for the Cargo Reefer Operator Controls System. 10. List of Sources that Expressed Interest in Writing: To date, no qualiﬁed sources, other than Trident Maritime Systems, have expressed an interest in writing. However, when applicable, the requirement will be advertised through FEDBIZOPPS. 1&A Control Number: N 104-19—R»4600 CERTIFICATION AND APPROVALS Technical/Requirements Cognizance: I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justiﬁcation and which form a basis for this justiﬁcation are complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Revise paragraph L—l 1, SECURITY REQUIREMENTS Provide answers to questions by potential offerors regarding the solicitation, The Govemment’s answers to the questions are as follow: Q1: Is this a new requirement? If not, could you please identify the incumbent? Answer: This is a new requirement, Q2: The SOW requires signiﬁcant travel to various locations where the infrastructures are . being evaluated. Could you please identify the various locations or at least provide ballpark number of locations, naval bases, ports, etc being evaluated? Answer: The Government does not anticipate signiﬁcant travel to various locations where the infrastructures are being evaluated The Government anticipates the work will mostly consist of experimental investigations to verify modeling, using a small mock-up to explore vulnerabilities of key components or system pieces. The offerors should propose travel trips commensurate with its proposed technical solution for this requirement. Q3: Are most of the locations Naval facilities? Answer: No, Contractors may be required to travel to NRL-DC, Q4: Are the required key personnel Program Manager and Lead Engineer? Answer: No, it is up to the Offeror to identify which skill category proposed is key and provide resume of the key personnel The table provided in paragraph L~l4 is only a sample. QS: The Solicitation implies that a facility clearance is required and that personnel require security clearances, however the DD 245 states No facility clearance is required and no safeguarding is required. Which is correct? This requirement is unclassiﬁed, therefore, facility clearance is not required, Contractor personnel may be required to work onsite at N'RL—DC and must adhere to the requirements provided in Attachment 0002 - Requirements for Onsite Contractors.

See “SUMMARY OF CHANGES” section for revisions/updates, 2. Provide answers to questions by potential offerors regarding the solicitation. Questions and answers are as follow: Q1: RFP page 62, L-13(d) indicates offerors may submit by e-mail but all other instructions indicate 1 original, 2 copies, and an electronic copy. Can you conﬁrm that proposals sent exclusively by e-mail will be accepted? Answer: The Government requires both hard and electronic copies. Digital copies may be submitted via email or DVD. Paragraphs L~13, L-14, L—lS, L—16 are updated to provide clariﬁcation. Q2: The SOW provides insufﬁcient data to determine the actual scope of effort. Is this intended as an IDIQ contract where the customer will provide speciﬁc research tasks prior to the actual effort or is there an expectation that the contractor deﬁne the scope of research and speciﬁc pans in the technical proposal? Answer: No, the Government will not issue an IDIQ contract, The Government will issue a single award Cost-Plus-Fixed—Fee Term type contract. For speciﬁc tasks, the Government will issue Technical Direction Memorandums (TDM) in accordance with paragraph G-S at page 27, Q3: Is the research described in the solicitation intended to identify vulnerabilities at a single location, at all Navy/Marine sites CONUS and OCONUS, provide a spot check of a couple locations, or just be a general “state-of—the-union\" snapshot of USN status? Answer: The research will focus on speciﬁc vulnerabilities for sectors identiﬁed in the SOW. The topics investigated are to answer detailed technical questions on speciﬁc, identiﬁed weaknesses. The research includes computer model development, involving mechanical, physical, chemical, and/or economic phenomena. The research will also include an independent veriﬁcation of computer models that have already been developed, and in some cases will provide experimental corroboration. Other work may involve ﬁnding and subcontracting with topic specialists. The topics will be short term and vary widely, to include the range identiﬁed in the Statement of Work, during the course of the contract. Solicitation N00173-18-R-ZL02 Amendment 0002 Page 3 of 9 Below is a sample topic for this contract: Verify a combustion model of a burning pool of oil of a speciﬁed composition and given dimensions. Are the stated assumptions reasonable? Test the prediction -- does the code produce answers that are in consistent with those assumptions? Provide a report that demonstrates (or not) the code verification. The research topics can be on vulnerabilities for any infrastructure, CONUS or OCONUS, and not just those found in Navy/Marine sitesi Q4: The instructions for the cost proposal do not provide sufficient info how to price travel, materials, or labor without speciﬁc tasks or requirements. Can the Government please clarify how pricing is to be performed? Answer: Offerors should propose and price travel, material, and labor commensurate with its technical proposal. See response at Question 15 for the estimated labor hours The Government will conduct analysis of the proposed cost in accordance section M of the solicitation. Q5: Is the table on page 63 of the RFP a government estimate of effort? If not, can the government please provide an estimate? Answer: No, the table at page 63 is only a sample matrix. As stated at page 63, “The Offercr shall propose personnel with essential education level, experience and qualiﬁcation which it deemed necessary to successfully perform the tasks set forth in the SOW.\" Q6: Past Performance requirements on page 64 requests 3-5 examples over the past 3 years. Is it the intention to exclude companies with less than 3 relevant contracts? Answer: The Government will not exclude companies with less than 3 relevant contracts. If companies do not have recent or relevant performance record available, companies will receive “Unknown Conﬁdence (Neutral)” IAW Section M. Q7: Can CPARS reports for past performance he used in lieu of soliciting work from overburdened government employees to ﬁll-out past performance reports? Answer: Offeror must adhere to instructions provided in Section L. Q8: The Navy and Marines operate over 200 facilities around the world and frequently rely upon private sector and municipality resources that contribute to potential vulnerabilities. Each site has unique characteristics. Each area of Solicitation N00173-18-R-ZL02 Amendment 0002 Page 4 of 9 infrastructure research could require a separate team of inspectors and subject matter experts. As a result, the research could involve thousands of contractor employees. On the other hand, the work could involve a single well educated expert with an eye toward identifying problems. Can the government please provide a scope for the proposed effort? Answer: See responses provided for Question #3 and Question 15. Q9: Is the risk assessment solely for CONUS installations or does it include overseas locations? Is travel to regions of conﬂict anticipated? Answer: Brief, one or two-day site visits may be needed, but these are not anticipated to be a major part of the effort. There will be no travel to regions of active conﬂict. Q10: On the solicitation document, page 62 L-l3 (d) states that, “offerors may submit proposals via email to the contract specialist at zun.lin@nrltnmy.mil. Please ensure that each volume is sent as a separate attachment.” Does this mean that offerors may submit proposals via email instead of hard copy? If yes, do we need to submit the required original and 2 copies of each volume via email? Or does this mean that offerors can submit both ways, but you still want hard copies mailed? Answer: The Govemment requires both hard and electronic copies. See summary of changes below for clariﬁcation. Q11: Does the Government have a priority of technical directives based on topic area (e.g. Energy, Transportation, etc.)? If so, can they share that with those proposing? Answer: No, the Government does not anticipate developing such priorities 012: Is the Government’s expectation that the focus of R&D be solely on Navel assets and installations or on the nation as a whole?

Para G-9(e)(7) states as a minimum TDMs shall include the anticipated level of effort, materials, and travel expected as a result of the TDM. To form a basis of estimate for the Statement of work, offerors will need a way to quantify the level of effort anticipated in the TDMs. a. Will the government provide an estimated number of tasks to be required in CLINs l, 2, and 3 for the base year and each option year? And Answer: The Government has identiﬁed three tasks to be investigated currently, and anticipates 4-8 tasks in the ﬁrst year. For subsequent years, the effort is expected to increase. b. Will the government provide the anticipated number hours of which labor category, anticipated material, and anticipated travel for each task? 0R Answer: The Government estimates the level of effort for each performance period to be the following: Period of Base Performance Year 0Y1 0Y2 0Y3 0Y4 TOTAL Estimated Labor Hours 4800 8320 12480 15680 17920 59200 Please note the estimate is provided for informational purposes only, and should be construe as the not to exceed or required labor hours necessary to support this contract.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, ' S. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. Boeing was awaxded the P-SA System Development and Demonstration Contract N00019704~C~3146 under a best value limited competition. The P-BA consists of a. basic 737-800 ERX air vehicle modiﬁed to meet Navy requirements, to include systems and ‘ subsystems for avionics, communications, mission, and weapon capabilities. Boeing has been ’dle prime and only integrator of the aforementioned P-SA systems and subsystems, and therefore has the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government‘s requirements. Due to the proprietary nature of some of the commercially derived P—SA components, access to the technical damnecessary to support a full and open competition is, in some cases, not feasible, Although the Government has purchased some software design documentation and reqm'remenls' speciﬁcations, it has not purchased a complete tecbnical data and computer soﬁWare package. Therefore, Boeing is the only responsible source that will satisfy the Navy’s requirements. 6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offer from as Many Offerors as Pracﬁcahle. NAVAIR synopsized the BOA to the governmentewide point of entry (FedEizOpps website - wwwibo. gov) on 24 March-201’s, and included a point of contact for subcontracting opportlmities to broaden industry and small business participation. Though a formal market survey was not performed for the BOA, each order will be independently-synopsized on wwwibogov in accordance with FAR. 5.201, speciﬁcally stating the Government’s intent and rationale to contract sole-source with Boeing. The contracting ofﬁcer will evaluate all responses received prior to award of each order. In accordance with DFARS PGI 206.30271(d), 5. Sources Sought Notice was posted on wwwibogov on 12 June 2015. On 17 June 2015, McMurdo Group expressed interest in providing its emergency locator beacons and transmitters to NAVAIR. NAVAIR conveyed to McMmdo Group that any BOA contract action requirements for emergency DEC/U3/2015/THU 04:02 PM P. 003 CJKLA Number: 16-0015 locator beacons and/or transmitters would be individually synopsized on www.fbo.gov, providing McMurdo Group the opportunity to submit either a proposal or Capability Statement. No other responses were received No additional market research was conducted because it is not practical, for ﬁle reasons discussed in paragraph 5 above, for any company other than Boeing to provide the required supplies and services. 7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Ofﬁcer shall ensure that all supplies and services are procured at a fair and reasonable price. An analysis of the contractor’s proposals will be performed by technical analysts and contract specialists, with the assistance of Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) auditors as needed. The Contracting‘Officer will analyze the various cost elements that are presented in proposals, as well as review the acmals from previous procurements, if applicable The Contracting Ofﬁcer will use Government expertise, including PCMA, DCAA, the Program Ofﬁce, and other Government resources, to evaluate each proposal’s material, labor and subcontract positions. A detailed report developed as part of the Government evaluation will be utilized to establish a NAVAIR position. Lfa rate agreement is not in place between Boeing and DCMA at the time of proposal evaluation, the Contracting Ofﬁcer will work with DCMA r and DCAA to establish a rate position; to include escalation, for negotiation of the connect action. As discussed in this paragraph, the Contracting Ofﬁcer will use cost and price analysis as the basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price for the supplies/services covered by this CJ&A. 8. Actions to Remove Barriers on Future Competition. For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NAVAIR Headquarters has no plans at this time to compete future contacts for the types of supplies/services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NAVAIR Headquarters will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.

The Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (USCG), Telecommunication and Information Systems Command (TISCOM) Enterprise Information Systems Infrastructure Product Line (EISI-PL), proposes to enter into a contract on the basis of a limited—sources justification. (2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. It is the intent of the US. Coast Guard to award a limited source, brand name BPA Call under the DHS Enterprise Software Solutions (ESS) Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) Blanket Purchase Agreement (EPA) for NetApp hardware from Unicom Government, Inc. to support the USCG virtualized desktop solution and access to the networks, at an estimated cost of $786,129.60 (3) Description of Supplies/Services. The requirement is for the acquisition of additional commercial brand name specific Netapp hardware to support the expansion of the USCG Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Remote Desktop capabilities to 6000 concurrent remote users. The current infrastructure does not meet this standard The acquisition of NetApp storage solutions provide expanded connection capability and increased storage for the current in place Remote Desktop solution The estimated price for this equipment is $786,129.60.

The data center this equipment is to be installed on is comprised of 100% NetApp equipment to ensure interoperability and compatibility Due to the highly complex nature of the equipment involved, the installation of non-brand name equipment within this environment would result in compatibility conﬂicts that would adversely impact the operating environment. The procurement ofnon-brand name equipment would require a complete reengineering of the VDI environment resulting in signiﬁcant expense in labor and additional equipment (5) Determination by the ordering activity contracting ofﬁcer that the anticipated order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d). The contracting ofﬁcer determines that the anticipated pricing will be fair and reasonable based on previously competed NETAPP products in the award of HSHQDC-l l-A-00042, the DHS ESS ELA BPA. The DHS BPAs have negotiated additional discounts to the GSA schedule prices and those prices were determined fair and reasonable The Contracting Ofﬁcer will also perform a price analysis to determine that the price at the time of award is fair and reasonable and is consistent with the EPA and contract terms. (6) A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results, or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted Market research conducted among schedule holders showed the following: 1) First Source II will be expiring prior to the requirement ending. 2) GSA Schedule 70 or use of other IDIQ/GWAC such as SW'EP or ITES-3S will extend the procurement cycle well beyond the critical stages of the virtualization project, 3) DHS EPA is a stable well-established DI-IS Strategic Contracting vehicle meeting the needs of all components agencies within DHS Market research indicates that pricing via this BPA represents best pricing compared to alternate procurement methods including DHS First Source II and GPA Schedule. (7) Any other facts supporting the justification. No Additional Factsr (8) A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that preclude the agency from meeting the requirements of 8.405—1 and 8.405-2 before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made. The USCG intends on re-competing the virtual desktop service within the next 36 months which will allow adequate competition among both brand names and Vendors for follow on task orders for storage hardware/media. (9) Contracting Ofﬁcer’s Certiﬁcation.

COAST GUARD (USCG) OFFICE OF STANDARDS EVALUATION AND DEVELOPMENT (CG-REG) LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION 1. Identiﬁcation of Agency and Contracting Activity: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), US. Coast Guard (USCG), Ofﬁce of Standards Evaluation and Development (CG-REG) proposes to enter into a sole source task order with Infogroup for regulatory development economists to obtain small business/entities information for their required “regulatory ﬂexibility analysis\" (RFA) or Small Business Impact Analysis through a ReferenceUSA database subscription The contracting activity is the USCG Ofﬁce of Contract Operations (CG-9124) at USCG Headquarters. 2. Description of Action beingApproved: This action requests approval to procure a proprietary database that provides USCG economists with information to conduct regulatory impact analyses including analyses of risk and uncertainty, as appropriate, for all USCG rulernakings considered economically signiﬁcant, Furthermore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U,S.C, chapter 6), requires agencies to prepare a \"regulatory ﬂexibility analysis\" (RFA) or Small Business Impact Analysis if the rulemaking could “have a signiﬁcant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\" 3.

In accordance with Executive Order 12866. the USCG is required to conduct regulatory impact analyses including analyses of risk and uncertainty, as appropriate, for all rulemakings considered economically signiﬁcant Furthermore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), requires agencies to prepare a \"regulatory ﬂexibility analysis\" (RFA) or Small Business Impact Analysis ifthe rulemaking could ”have a signiﬁcant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,\" The RFA must: 0 Assesses the economy or industry that will be regulated 1 LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION - InfoUSA — ReferenceUSA Database I Estimate the classes of small entities which will be subject to the regulation O Describe the regilated entities by size and number - Estimate economic impact by regulated entities size category - Determine which size categories incur signiﬁcant economic impacts - Include threshold analysis to certify a rule as requiring no further analysis or begin Initial/Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis - Respond to any comments ﬁled by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) in response to the proposed rule CG-REG economists must obtain this information from at a nationwide level for various North American Industry Classiﬁcation System (NAICS) codes using Small Business Administration information, with local granularity, including a defensible estimate of the number of small entities affected by a rule. The scope of information is broad and complex, as a small entity may be: a small independent business, deﬁned as independently owned and operated, is organized for proﬁt, and is not dominant in its ﬁeld per the Small Business Act (5 USC. 632); a small not-for—proﬁt organiution (any not-for-proﬁt enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its ﬁeld); or a small governmental jurisdiction (locality with fewer than 50,000 people). In addition to entity populations by type, economists must also determine ownership structure, revenue data, employee numbers and small business thresholds. Their classiﬁcations of small entities also includes by NAICS code, with many small entities having multiple NAICS codes and oﬁen have a primary NAICS code that is not related to the subject of the rulemaking. 4. Identiﬁcation of Justiﬁcation Rationale and Demonstration of proposed Contractor's unique qualiﬁcations: The primary statutory authorities for GSA Professional Services Schedule are Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 3102 et seq.), and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies, FAR Part 8,405~6(a)(l)(i)(B) applies to this acquisition. Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized, FAR Part 8 requirements are exempt from the requirements in FAR Part 6. Based on the information listed below, Infogroup is the only contractor that can meet USCG regulatory impact analyses requirements for identifying, classifying, and describing small entities (including small businesses) and then determining and estimating economic impact of proposed USCG regulations on them. USCG requires a database service that is capable of: I Characterizing the economy or industry that will be regulated, including its scope, including by NAICS and Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC) codes 0 Identifying the classes of small entities which will be subject to the regulation and their makeup and population I Determining the ownership structure or jurisdiction of small entities I Determining the small business thresholds for applicable entities . Describing the regulated entities by size and number 2 LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION » InfoUSA - ReferenceUSA Database 0 Determining which size categories incur signiﬁcant economic impacts by revenue, number of employees and other attributes The business information found in ReferenceUSA makes it a crucial one stop tool used by CG-REG economists to obtain the extensive information cited above, to prepare RFA and other required regulatory economic analyses. ReferenceUSA offers a comprehensive, consistent, and up to date source information used in research on the size and ownership of businesses potentially impacted by proposed Coast Guard regulations along with their employment numbers and company revenue data. For instance, the information on sales (revenues) and ownership of over 24 million US. businesses is one of the types found in ReferenceUSA. Based on the aforementioned, Infogroup is the only known source capable of providing a database service that is capable of meeting all of the government's requirements. 5. Determination that the Order Represents the Best Value: In accordance with FAR 8.404(d), General Services Administration (GSA) hasalready determined that the prices of services under Schedule contracts are fair and reasonable, Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing. Prior to placing the order, the Contracting Officer will seek further price reductions from Infogroup's Professional Services Schedule contract GS~23F-0096P, under Special Item Number (SIN) 520—16. Market research has shown that the services required are under this Infogroup's GSA Professional Services Schedule contract. This contract is currently scheduled through January 15, 2024 and Pricelist is current through Modiﬁcation #P0-0033, dated August 10, 2018. 6. Market Research Market research was conducted with two questions in mind. First, are there other available services on the market that can meet the needs of the Government; and second, what is the best procurement approach for such services Relative to question one, there are other databases available to USCG but during the market research phase, no other database Was found that can meet all of the requirements enumerated above. In reviewing the other contract terms and conditions under SIN 520-16, some of the databases could meet some of the regulatory economic analyses information requirements listed above. Alternative information and data sources are not as comprehensive, and in many cases not as in-depth, as ReferenceUSA, CG-REG would have to have multiple subscriptions to other data sources to achieve the same research capability as having ReferenceUSA and economists would then have to aggregate and organize the information at considerable additional time and effort. For instance, Thomson Reuters Special Services LLC, under contract GS-23F-0089W, provides some business search information, but does not meet all of the required capabilities listed above. Relative to question two, access to the Infogroup's ReferenceUSA database can be obtained from both the Infogroup FSS contract as well as from Fedlink (a Library of Congress subscription source), but the pricing on the GSA contract is more favorable to the Government. Infogroup's ReferenceUSA is the only database service from which all of the business data research needs identiﬁed above can be met, which is absolutely necessary/critical for USCG Regulatory Development Economists to accomplish their required analyses. LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION - InfoUSA — ReferenceUSA Database 7. Other Facts Supporting the use of the Justiﬁcation: The ReferenceUSA database of business and consumer information was created and developed by lnfoUSA aﬁer compiling and performing individual research from numerous sources. They are the sole provider of this data CG-REG has used ReferenceUSA since 2002 The previous award was under PO# HSCGS-lG-F-MSRI 16 8. A Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: The program has been advised to conduct continuous market research to identify other potential database services that can provide the support needed by USCG REG-1 in the future. Market research shall also be conducted by the CO at the end of each performance period prior to exercising any option period. Currently there are no other known vendors who can meet the government‘s requirement identiﬁed above."}

D Yes No Contracting Activity: ACC AMiC/JWAC Project/Program Name: Spectra Logic Purchase Request/identification Number: TBD Estimated Contract Cost (including Options): _ Sectlon B: Descrlptlon of the SupplleslServlces Requlred The Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC) has a brand name requirement for Spectra Logic‘s next business day on»site maintenance support, know as SpectraGuard, and telephone support for each of its three tape backup libraries JWAC currentiy utiiizes Spectra Logic Corporation tape libraries as an enterprise backup and continuity of operations pian (COOP) solution to meet JWAC and DoD requirements to maintain backups for one year on each of its three networks in use at the JWAC facility. This enterprise backup and COOP soiution is needed to meet both JWAC and DoD requirements while JWAC transitions to the JWAC Compartmented Computing Environment (JCCE) replacement solution. The current Spectra Guard Next Business Day onr site maintenance support contract is scheduled to expire on 14 August 2019. Therefore,JWAC has a requirement to purchase one year of maintenance support for the Spectra Logic tape libraries until JWAC completeiy transitions to the JWAC Compartmented Computing Environment (JCCE) replacement solution. JCCEiU has repiaced the UNET and its tape library backup; therefore, maintenance for the UNET tape library is not required. Section C: Justification for Soliciting from a Single Source or Brand Name Spectra Logic Corporation is the manufacturer of JWAC‘s current proprietary data storage library hardware. As such, only Spectra Logic or its authorized service providers and trained technicians and personnel possess the knowledge, skill, and resources to perform repairs, rercertifications, and other services covered under the terms of the annual maintenance contract. In addition, Spectra Logic and its authorized sen/ice providers are able to meet serVice level schedules and maintain criticai response times, Spectra Logic has authorized reseliers that may resell Spectra Logic support contracts; however, reseilers do not have the capability to provide support at ali of the support ieveis. Unauthorized third party service providers do not have access to the proprietary diagnostic tools, firmware and software required to keep the products up to date With all current changes. Oniy Spectra Logic certified and authorized service providers have the capability to execute the services provided for under the annual maintenance contract due to the proprietary manufactured hardware, firmware, and software. JWAC has spent considerable time, money, and effort in developing the JCCE operating environment that wiil replace the current Spectra Logic tape backup solution. Since JCCE is expected to be ready within a year, it would not be in the best interests of the Government, either fiscally or operationaily, to go With an alternative backup soiution to the current SpectraGuard soiution employed. Therefore, this procurementwill be limited to a brand name requirement. Sectlon D: Efforts to Obtaln Competltlon Market research determined thatthe required maintenance support for Spectra Logic tape libraries is not availablethrough DoD ESI or GSA. An open market solicitation makes JWAC's requirement available to the Originai Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and ali Spectrai Logic authorized service providers, and gives them the ability to provide a solution to meet JWAC's needs for SpectraGuard support and telephone support untii JCCE becomes operationai.

The technical narrative shall provide an in-depth description of the Offeror’s experience and capability to perform the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW). Statements that the Offeror understands, can, or will perform the requirements of the SOW without supporting information or narratives are inadequate. Paraphrasing the SOW or parts thereof, is similarly inadequate, as are phrases such as “standard procedures will be employed” or “well—known techniques will be used\".

References shall explicitly state the complete contract number. Offeror’s may be asked to respond to adverse past performance information Adverse past performance is deﬁned as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation aspect or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system In order to be considered, the PPQ’s shall be returned by the evaluator to Robert Sheehan, Contract Specialist at rashcch a2cybercommil and proposal submission®cybercommil no later than 12:00 Noon EST on 19 April 2019, The Offeror must provide a summary table of the past performance efforts included in the volume similar to the table below The past performance reference must explain in detail the relevancy and recency of each reference to the tasks required in the SOWr When a past performance effort concerns work performed by the Offeror’s proposed subcontractor, the table below (as modiﬁed by the Offeror) and the past performance volume must clearly explain how the past performance of the proposed subcontractor relates to the tasks expected to be performed by the proposed subcontractor under this contract, This table will count in the page count. Page 6 of13 UNCLASSlFlED UNCLASSIFIED Reference Prime/Sub Program Awarded SOW Contract POC/Contact Name Name/Title Agency Amount Section POP Information 1 2 Offeror shall demonstrate understanding of the requirement by providing past performance information presented showing the offerors ability to meet price/cost, schedule, and performance requirements in providing solutions similar in to t ose in the size, scope, and complexity required y this acquisition. When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by offerors in their proposal, PPQ responses, as well as past performance information obtained from other sources The offeror is responsible for ensuring that the data they submit is thorough, accurate, and complete in addressing all solicitation requirements. In addition, past performance information presented will document the offeror’s ability to meet recency, relevancy, and quality information. 1. Recency. Offerors shall submit recent past performance, performed since September 2016 for a period of at least 12 months, 2. Relevancy. Offerors shall submit past performance that is relevant and similar to this effort in terms of the type of support services, complexity, and dollar value in providing solutions similar to those in the scope, complexity, and size required by this acquisition To further clarify: I Offerors may submit Past Performance references less than a contract value of at least $20 million. However, Offerors are reminded that pursuant to Section M which states, “Aspects of relevancy evaluation will include the following: similarity to SNOOK support services, complexity, and dollar value\". As such the Agency will evaluate relevancy across all four of these relevancy elements including dollar value. Therefore, Offerors submitting contract references as part of their past performance submission that are less than $2.0 million may result in a lower relevancy score when dollar value is evaluated along with all of the other three past performance elements listed above, Offerors may submit Indefinite Delivery Indeﬁnite Quality (IDIQ) Past Performance references (“D” type contract). However, the reference must only be for the relevant Task Order for which the work was performed and identify the specific dollar value of the Task Order, Each Task Order listed will be considered a separate Past Performance reference, The referenced Task Order dollar value should at lease be $20 million to be considered relevant. In addition, for any subcontractor Past Performance references, the dollar value must reflect the value of the subcontract, not the prime contract dollar amount. 0 Past Performance references should state how services were accomplished to support missions similar to this effort Past Performance references that only state an offeror supported a location/agency that provided Services similar to the this requirement Page 7 of13 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED without describing how that support was accomplished and how such support related to the SNOOK SOW will make it more difﬁcult for the Government to evaluate the relevancy of that particular reference to the SNOOK SOW requirements As such, past performance references submitted without describing how the strategic all-source analysis was provided and how such support related to the SNOOK SOW could potentially result in a lower relevancy rating for that reference as part of the Agency’s overall relevancy evaluation which includes all the relevancy evaluation elements identiﬁed in Section M and factor into the Government’s overall Past Performance Conﬁdence Assessment for the Offeror. 0 Past Performance references shall thoroughly address the sub-tasks in the SNOOK SOW. When comparing Offeror work to the SNOOK SOW sub-tasks, ensure each aspect of the task is addressed. - Highlighting the outcome of a past performance reference activity without describing the CI all source analytical steps taken to accomplish said outcome could potentially result in a lower relevancy rating for that reference as part of the Agency’s overall relevancy evaluation which includes all the relevancy evaluation elements identiﬁed in Section M and factor into the Government’s overall Past Performance Conﬁdence Assessment for the Offeror. 0 Using several past performance references to address the same task in the SNOOK SOW may result in a ﬁnding that the past performance references are only relevant to that certain aspect of the SNOOK SOW, as such the relevancy ratings for the references themselves will factor into the Govemment’s overall Past Performance Conﬁdence Assessment for the Offeror. 3. Quality. Offerors shall complete for each contract referenced, the information identiﬁed in Section I of the form “Past Performance Questionnaire” at Attachment 2 and email the questionnaire to the technical representative responsible for the referenced past/current contract. The questionnaire states that the technical representative should complete Section 2 of the questionnaire and email entire questionnaire within the date and time designated on the questionnaire to the point of contact designated within Section 4.2 of this document. Offerors may request/remind the technical representative to complete and email the form to the POC listed on the questionnaire NOTE: Offerors shall clearly identify themselves on the form as the proposing cfferor so that questionnaires can be tracked to the correct vendor. 4.4.

It is the Offerors’ responsibility to review this location periodically for updates and/or amendments. 7.7 DISCUSSIONS - The Government does not contemplate holding discussions, however, it reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary. The primary objective of discussions is to maximize the Govemment’s ability to obtain best value, based on the requirement and the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation, If discussions are necessary due to perceived weaknesses or other issues that must be addressed before award, the Government will evaluate all Offeror’s proposals in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 and establish the competitive range. Based on ratings of each proposal against ALL evaluation criteria, the Contracting Ofﬁcer will establish the competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efﬁciency. If the Contracting Ofﬁcer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efﬁcient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Ofﬁcer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efﬁcient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Discussions resulting from the competitive range determination may be conducted in writing and/or in verbal discussions as follows: Written and/or verbal discussions will be utilized by issuing Evaluation Notices (ENS). The Contracting Ofﬁcer will issue ENS to Offerors within the competitive range to communicate those areas of his or her proposal which are considered deficient, where weaknesses exist, or where other aspects of the Offeror’s proposal (such as cost, price, technical/management capability, past performance and terms and conditions) are signiﬁcant enough to affect the selection decision and/or where data presented by the Offeror is unclear. 7.8 PROPOSAL REVISIONS - Revisions to either the technical or Price proposal shall have changed information clearly marked by a vertical line in the right margin of the page, Offerors are cautioned that changes or revisions at the ﬁnal proposal revision stage may render a proposal unacceptable for award. Page I3 of13 UNCLASSlFlED\tSection_M.pdf: UNCLASSIFIED/NOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Oct 2014) ADDENDA — EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD BASIS FOR AWARD I. This is a best value evaluation conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15,101-1, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), The Govemment will award to the best overall offer based upon an integrated assessment of the overall Technical & Management, Past Performance, and Price factors below The Government will award one (1) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements and is evaluated, based on evaluation factors, to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the greatest conﬁdence, and best meets or exceeds the requirements. This may result in an award to the higher rated and/or higher priced Offeror, For example, where the decision is consistent with evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the higher rated non-priced factor responses of the higher Price offeror outweighs the price difference the SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation, 2. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government The Government will select the best overall offer based on the following evaluation criteria: Factor 1 — Technical & Management Factor 2 - Past Performance Factor 3 - Price The relative order of importance for evaluation factors are as follows: Factor 1 - Technical and Management is more important than Factor 2 - Past Performance. The Non-Price factors (Factors 1 and 2) when combined are SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN Factor 3 - Price in the award decision. For Factor 1 7 Technical and Management, all sub-factors are listed in order of importance and will be weighted into the overall Factor 1 7 Technical and Management Factor 4 - Price becomes increasingly more important in award selection when other criteria are substantially equal, This process permits trade-offs among Price and non-price factors and allows the Government to select other than the lowest Price proposal, or other than the highest technically rated offer, The Government intends to award without discussions If the Government decides that it is necessary to hold discussions, then a Competitive Range determination will be made based upon the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA FAR 2.10] AND 3.104 UNCLAI SIFIEDHFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY UNCLASSIFIED/TOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 3, The Government may or may not establish a competitive range aﬁer evaluating all proposals, If discussions are to be conducted, a competitive range will be established prior to the commencement of discussions. Based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of the highest rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposed of efficiency. To be considered for award, each offeror‘s proposal shall at a minimum, across all factors, meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW), shall indicate an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Additionally, to be considered for award the proposal’s strengths and weaknesses shall at a minimum be offsetting and have little or no impact on contract performance therefore indicating risk of unsuccessful performance will be no worse than moderate. 4 The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or to other than Offeror with the highest technical score if the Contracting Ofﬁcer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government, However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical and management features, 5 Security: A TOP SECRET facility clearance is required under this solicitation Offerors shall address compliance with the DRAFT DD254 attached to the solicitation by providing the Government with its Cage Code identifying that the Offeror holds a TOP SECRET facility clearance. The Cage Code must belong to the Offeror (Prime). Prior to evaluating proposals, the Government will review each Offeror’s Cage Code to ensure compliance with the security requirement in the attached DD254i Offerors who “fail” to hold a TOP SECRET facility clearance as outlined in the attached Form DD254 of this solicitation will not be further considered for award. Offerors who hold a TOP SECRET facility clearance will “pass” this review and will be further considered for award 6. Evaluation Factors: The Government will use the following evaluation factors to evaluate each proposal, Award will be made to the offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: A, Factor 1 7 Technical & Management C, Factor 2 — Past Performance D. Factor 3 - Price EVALUATION PROCEDURES. FACTOR 1 — TECHNICAL & MANAGEMENT: The technical and management rating evaluates the Offeror’s understanding of and approach to performing the Government‘s requirements, and the extent to which the proposal demonstrates experience performing similar requirements. Factor I 7 Technical Capability will receive one of the ratings described Table 3, Technical Capability Ratings. SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA FAR 2101 AND 3.104 UNCLASSIFIED/NOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s proposal to determine the extent to which it indicates an understanding of the requirements, provides a convincing rationale on how the proposed approach will meet or exceed the requirements, and demonstrates previous experience meeting similar requirements The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror’s demonstrated understanding, approach, and experience provide the Government with a high level of conﬁdence of successful completion within the required schedule. (U) The Goverrunent will utilize the combined technical/risk rating against each sub-factor and then weigh all sub-factors to determine the overall FACTOR 1 rating. Table 1 below outlines the ratings and their descriptions: (U) Combined Technical/Risk Ratings Ratin Deﬁnition (U) Proposal indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements and contains multiple strengths, and risk of unsuccessful erformance is low. (U) Proposal indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements and contains at least one strength, and risk of unsuccessful erforrnance is low to moderate. (U) Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. (U) Proposal has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and/or risk of unsuccessﬁil performance is high. (U) Proposal does not meet requirements of the solicitation, and thus, contains one or more deﬁciencies, and/or risk of unsuccessful performance is unacceptable, Proposal is un-awardable, To support the Technical/Risk rating noted above, me Government shall use the following deﬁnitions in Table 2: (U) Deﬁnitions of Strengths and Weaknesses Rating Deﬁnition Signiﬁcant An aspect of the proposal that appreciably increases the likelihood of Strength successful contract performance. Strength An aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has merit or exceeds speciﬁed performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance. Weakness A ﬂaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. Significant A ﬂaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful Weakness contract performance. SOURCE SF, FICTION CRITERIA FAR 2.101 AND 3.104 UNCLASSIFIFI)//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY UNCLASSIFIED/NOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Deﬁcienc A material failure of a r0 osal to meet a Government re uirement or a y i . p p (.1 , combination of Signiﬁcant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level, The Sub-Factors used to evaluate each proposal are as follows: SUBFACTOR 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILTY The Government will assess the depth and breadth of the Offeror’s overall knowledge of contract requirements, to include: stafﬁng structure, Offeror’s approach to collaboration fostering working groups focused on delivering responses to cyber-peculiar legislative and budgetary inquiries, and strategic-level cyber initiatives, SUBFACTOR 2: RESUME SAMPLING The Govemment will assess the Offeror’s capability to provide sufficiently qualiﬁed team members and personnel to successfully execute the proposed solutions The evaluation will focus on the depth and breadth of personnel qualiﬁcations (education, skills and experience) and recent relevant experience (within the past three years) as it relates to the speciﬁc requirements of the Statement of Work. SUBFACTOR 3: PROJECT MANAGEMENT The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s draﬂ Project Management Plan in terms of its ability to efficiently resource, manage, and control costs of contract requirements (ie, obtain, allocate, monitor and control resources and costs for the entire life cycle of the contract), The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s and subcontractors’/team members’ proposed corporate mechanisms applicable to all employees (practices, policies, and procedures) that will be employed by the Prime Offeror and subcontractors/team members to recruit and retain a sufﬁcient number of qualiﬁed personnel to ensure successful accomplishment of the proposed technical and management approaches throughout the life of the contract, The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s ability to provide the following stafﬁng mix and timeline: 1) all key personnel nominated within 5 days of award; 2) 100% of staff nominated within 10 days of award; 3) 95% of stafﬁng level maintained throughout the contract in accordance with the stafﬁng requirements of the SOW, FACTOR 2 — PAST PERFORMANCE: The past performance evaluation results in an assessment of the Offeror’s probability of meeting the solicitation requirements The past performance evaluation considers each Offeror’s demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying services that meet the contract’s requirements One performance conﬁdence assessment rating is assigned for each Offeror aﬁer evaluating the Offeror‘s recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements In conducting the past performance evaluation the Government may use data included by SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA FAR 2101 AND 3.104 UNCLASSIFIED/NOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY UNCLASSIFIEDNl‘OR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Offerors in their proposals, past performance questionnaires, as well as, past performance information obtained from other sources. Adverse past performance information will be evaluated and included as part of the conﬁdence assessment, There are three aspects to the past performance evaluation: Recency. The ﬁrst is to evaluate the recency of the offeror’s past performance. The two (2) contracts references must have both been performed since March 2016 for at least a period of 12 months to be considered recent. Recency is the time period during which past performance references are considered relevant, and is critical to establishing the relevancy of past performance information Relevancy. The second is to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the Offeror is to the effort to be acquired through the source selection. In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration shall be given to those aspects of an offeror’s contract history that would give the greatest ability to measure whether the offeror will successfully satisfy the current requirement. Aspects of relevancy evaluation will include the following: similarity to SNOOK support services, complexity, and dollar value. In addition, the relevancy evaluation will include: contract value, related support services were accomplished to support a similar SNOOK mission and how it relates to the SNOOK SOW, and the capability to perform all task areas of the SNOOK SOW, Each past performance submission will receive one of the past performance relevancy ratings found in Table 4. With the respect to relevancy. more relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more inﬂuence on the past performance conﬁdence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance, ln evaluation of the relevancy of the offeror’s past performance, the goverment shall assign a rating from Table 4 below: Rating Deﬁnition Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires Somewhat Present/past performance efforts involved some of the scope and Relevant magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires, Not Relevant PresenUpast performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. SOURCE SELI-IC'I‘ION CRITERIA FAR 2.10] AND 3,104 UNCLASSIFIEDHI’OR OFFICIAL USE ONLY UNCLASSIFIED/NOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Quality. The third is to establish the overall quality of the offeror’s past performance from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contract. The quality evaluation will be based on the comments from the Past Performance Questionnaire’s (PPQS) submitted as well as the data provided in the Offeror’s proposal and data obtained from other sources. The Government will review all past performance information collected and determine the quality of the offeror’s performance, general trends, and usefulness of the information and incorporate these into the performance conﬁdence assessment. The past performance conﬁdence assessment rating is based on the offeror’s overall record of recency, relevancy, and quality of performance The Government will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance conﬁdence assessment. In conducting a performance conﬁdence assessment, each offeror shall be assigned one of the ratings from Table 5 below. Rating Description Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, Satisfactory Conﬁdence Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Govemment has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Neutral Conﬁdence No recentjrelevant performance record is available or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful conﬁdence assessment rating can be reasonable assigned. The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factors of past performance. Limited Conﬁdence Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No Conﬁdence Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. A signiﬁcant achievement, problem or lack of relevant data in any element of the work can become an important consideration in the source selection process, A negative ﬁnding under any element may result in an adverse performance confidence assessment. Therefore, offerors are reminded to include all relevant past efforts, included demonstrated corrective actions, in their proposal. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the past performance assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror’s proposal and data obtained from other SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA I’AR 2.101 AND 3.104 UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY UNCLASSIFIEDNFOR OFFICIAL USI’, ONLY sourcesi Since the Government may not necessarily contact all of the sources provided for the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving good past performance rests with the offerors, If there is no relevant past performance, the offeror will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably and such lack of relevant past performance will be considered an unknovm risk. (U) FACTOR 3 — COST: (U) Price will be evaluated for price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(1) based on the total proposed price for the base period of performance and all option periods together. The determination that the total price is reasonable will be made by a comparison of other offers received. If only one offer is received, the determination may be based on a comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) or by any other reasonable basis. Under no circumstances shall this intermatian and documentation be included elsewhere in the grogosuL Offerors shall provide: (U) Offeror shall propose fully burdened labor rates for each contract yeari In the format below Labor Category FTEs (1.0 = 1,920 Location hours) Cyber Strategy Consultant - National 30 Fort Meade, MD and International Policy SME Level 2 Cyber Strategy Consultant - DoD 1.0 Fort Meade, MD Policy Level 3 Cyber Strategy Consultant - .5 Fort Meade, MD Communications Technologist Level 1 (U) Labor rates shall be rounded to two (2) decimal spaces, All cells other than the Labor Rate cells are locked All formulas are provided and calculated. The excel sheet will automatically calculate the Extended Price by multiplying the Offeror’s pro Josedﬁtlly burdened labor rates by the number of F TEs by the number of hours illustrated (Rate x # FTEs x Hours).

NATURE 0R DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION: The purpose ofthis document is to obtain the necessary approvals for an exception of the fair opportunity acquisition in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)2(ii)(B) Orders exceeding the simpliﬁed acquisition threshold ($150,000) The procurement strategy is to issue a request for quote (RFQ) to CSC, Inc., the incumbent on the current contract, on the vendor’s GSA Alliant GWAC, 3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICE: DFAS requires labor services to maintain the SOMARDS system, provide help desk support and resolve production trouble reports to ensure the SOMARDS system is working correctly. SOMARDS is one system making up the Army's logistic modemization program (IMP). The LMP contract, which sought a modernized logistics solution, was initially awarded to CSC on 28 December 1999 to provide world class logistics readiness to the Warﬁghter. LMI’ program’s goal was a ﬁlly-integrated suite of software and business processes that would enable the Army to streamline the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), supply chain planning, acquisition and supply of weapon systems, spare pans, services and materiel to the Warﬁghters deployed world wide. Today, the program provides the Army with the data in a real‘time, usable manner In” Llrmb) l l l t JUSTIFICATION FOR AN gxggﬂjgu m E ant OFPORTQNITY SOMARDS necessary to manage a multi~billion dollar inventory with tens ofthousands of vendors, and it is integrated with more than 70 Department of Defense (Dc-D) systems, to include SOMARDS, SOMARDS is part of the general ledger system for the Anny Working Capital Fund (AWCF) nnd is part of the An-ny’s plan to meet ﬁnancial nuditability by 2017. 4. Identiﬁcation of the exception to Mr opportunity (see FAR 165050))(2): General Exceptions used as DFAS for the fair opportunity process: (a) Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies ordered are unique or highly specialized. (a) Reason that thls ls sole source grucurcmcnt {Lga REESE?! ggngustor's The proposed source is CSC North American Public Sector, 3160 Fairview Park Dr. Falls Church, VA 22042-4506. CSC is the prime contractor for the LMP Contract Number DAABO7-00-D—E252. No source other than CSC could satisfy this requirement because no other source has the unique understanding of how the program operates and is structured and expertise in developing code speciﬁcally for this program, which is required to maintain SOMARDS. This knowledge was gained by the resources working for over 14 years supporting and developing the LMP/SOMARDS. DFAS requires continuation of the sustainment and maintenance of the SOMARDS system to be working as an integral part of IMF. SOMARDS is extremely complex and inIricatei [t was built in the early 19805 using a lot of older technologies that few people stI have any expertise with. For example, it has a relational database 52K 2000 which is hierarchical and was developed in 1968 by the University ot‘Texas. It uses COBOL 74 (ver 2.4) and CICS code which are no longer taught in schools, so new programmers coming out of school have no knowledge ofit. Very few people know how to use COBOL 74 (ver 24) because it is an obsolete language In addition. SOMARDS runs on CDMR sottwnre which is a very old technology that uses queues to pass data back and forth. SOMARDS also uses T80 and ISPF which are old IBM environment software to perform certain functions and that need to be understood to maintain the system. Thus, SOMARDS is built out ofa number of old software pieces which are interrelated to achieve the needed functionality the system provides. ZoTS UST 0 AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR DPPO SOMARDS Because of this complexity, there is a small pool of available personnel who understand this system sufficiently to lake on the maintenance responsibility of such a system. Adding to the complexity, SOMARDS has numerous interfaces for sending and receiving data to and from other systems. It is not enough to know how to code a COBOL program to be able to maintain SOMARDS. Maintaining SDMARDS requires knowing the system and all the software that supports the system. Knowing how data ﬂows through all parts of the system and through interfaces and also knowing the unique needs of all the SOMARDS' customers, including the differences in their mainframe regions, is absolutely necessary. Without a strong knowledge and understanding of all of these aspects, it would he impossible to correctly respond to production trouble reports (PTRs) and perform other maintenance activity on SOMARDS. CSC has extensive experience in operating and maintaining SOMARDS that is not found in any other vendor. While it is feasible for another vendor to find programmers experienced in Cobol 74, those resources would still have to invest signiﬁcant time in leaming how the program is strucntred and operates before they would be able to maintain it. A different vendor would have to read L465 pages of directly related SOMARDS documentation and understand all of this material before being able to address a production problem. The vendor would also have to familiarize itself with 58 other related LMP system documentation ﬁles containing well over 10,000 pages of material. in addition, it would have to leam and understand the unique characteristics of the code to be able to maintain the system. Such an expenditure oftime would not be incurred by awarding to CSC. Considering this system is scheduled to be replaced in the near future, the investment oftime and effort by another vendor to develop the needed expertise to maintain SOMARDS is not warranted. By placing the order against the CSC's GSA Alliant GWAC, DFAS will receive the beneﬁt of competitively determined labor rates. Since the labor rates have already been determined through a competitive process, concerns with price reasonableness do not exist, nor is any price advantage gained hy further competition Using a different vendor would commit DFAS to having to pay them to learn the system and incur a higher cost from slower response times to production problems, both of which would be an additional expense to DFAS. Lastly, while the government owns all of the SOMARDS source code, then: are many third (3“) party software items that CSC has access to and agreements with vendors. Other vendors would have to obtain access to the 3\"I party software before they could maintain SOMARDS, which is a perfomance risk associated with transitioning to a different vendor. Thus, only CSC can provide needed support to SOMARDS as they are the only source who can provide the highly specialized services needed to maintain the SOMARDS system. Sufi E i E A EXCEPTION 'ro FAIR or TUNI SOMARDS A determination hy the Contracting Ofﬁcer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. In determining a fair and reasonable price, the Contracting Officer will evaluate the Independent Govemment Cost Estimate (1003). Based on an RFQ issued against the vendor's GSA Alliant GWAC, it is anticipated the pricing will be fair and reasonable, as determined under the terms and conditions of the RFQ. Based on market research, it is anticipated the vendor's GSA Alliant GWAC pricing will be lower than open market pricing 6. DESCRIPTION of MARKET SURVEY / EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION Availability and pricing information was sought from the GSA Alliant GWAC. CSC rates for the required labor categories needed are in line with other similar sized vendors on Allinnt with the same labor categories Market research was conducted for the purpose of validating fair and reasonable pricing. The rates posted on Alliant are comparable to the average rules for all 52 vendors on the GSA Alliant GWAC. 7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS There is nothing additional which has not already been stated throughout this document. 8.

A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any paid sick leave provided pursuant to E0 13766. VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor, 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the Page 16 Wage Determination 2815—4547 (064) performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174) THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUIER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 409) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.486). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS — NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. Page 11 Wage Determination 2015-4647 (004) If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). ** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL ** An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry—house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equip-ent being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in Page 12 Wage Determination 2915-4947 (994) those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of \"wash and wear\" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. ** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORV OF OCCUPATIONS ** The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\", Fifth Edition (Revision 1), dated September 2915, unless otherwise indicated. ** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444) ** Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees comenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). when multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a c1ass(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) when preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed c1assification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative Of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the Page 13 Wage Determination 2615-4047 (664) contracting officer no later than 36 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information incIUding the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). 4) within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the contractor. 6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)). Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper. when preparing a conformance request, the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)). Page 14"}

Market research completed from- through—did not produce any other vendors with the ability to provide the support required in this acquisition. This procurement was forecasted in the DHS APFS. No other company has contacted the USCG to request information on the APFS entry. FageJ of6 Justiﬁcation for Other Than Full and Open Companion Under 10 u.s.c. 2304 (a) (1) Only One Responsible Sauree and No Other Suppllas or Servlaaa Wlll Satisfy Agency Requirements HSCGJl-W-R-IMOM A sources sought notice was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on d closed on Two responses were received ﬁ’orn RCl and Porter Scientiﬁc, Inc. Porter Scientiﬁc did not provide a formal response; the companyjust requested additional information about the requirement. A second sources sought notioe was posted on the F30 website on~and closed on”to verify that RCI is the only source capable ofmeeting this requirement. Three responses were received from RC1, DLS Engineering, and Miracle Systems LLC. A technical capabilities review was performed by the government with Porter Scientiﬁ . lnc., DLS Engineering, and Miracle Systems LLC. The review determined that none of these three companies have the technical capability (ire. access to proprietary data) to meet this requirement. To ensure the information from the Sources Sought Notice is still accurate, Federal Logistics (F EDLOG). General Services Administration (GSA) Advantage, Department of Defense (DoD) Emall, Helicopter Association International Tradeshow 2016, and other lntemet sites (Google search engine) were searched and no additional information was obtained regarding Sustaining Engineering support. No other vendor capable of providing the required Sustaining Engineering support was found to be available at lhe time of the search, performed on February 8, 20l7. which further supports RCl's claim that no other vendors are able to provide the requirements of , this acquisition. (9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open oompetition, i.e., proprietary data packages, etc. None. (10) A Listing nl‘the souroes, ifany, that expreaaed in writing, an interest in the acquisition. As stated in Paragraph eight (8), Porter Scientiﬁc, Inc, DLS Engineering, and Miracle Systems LLC responded to the Sources Sought Notices posted mud“ None of the three (3) companies possess the proprietary data to be able to meet the identiﬁed requirements of this acquisition.

As stated in Paragraph ﬁve (5). RC1 maintains all pmprieury rights and does not grant these rights to any business, organization, pelmn or commercial interest. This policy has limited the USCG’s ability to provide adequate technical descriptions to potential new sources. Therefore, it is diﬁicult to take steps to foster competition IS the manufacturing, performance, and acceptance data are proprietary to the OEM. The USCG will continue market research efforts for future procurements. Pages ofﬁ"}

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Justiﬁcation and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition I. Contracting Activity. HQ AFRC/PKA 155 Richard Ray Blvd Robins AFB, GA 31098 ll. Mature and/or description of the action being processed. AFRC proposes to award a Not to Exceed Letter Contract that will result in a negotiated Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Labor Hour (LH) and Cost Reimbursable (CR) CLINS for work that cannot be accurately predicted. The contract will be for a period ofnine and o holf(9.5) months (1 March — 15 December 2019) to allow for completion ofcurrent follow-on acquisition plus a 60 day transition time. A Letter contract is necessary due to unusual time constraints to solicit, propose, and negotiate before the need date. This action is necessary due to extenuating circumstances leaving Westover ARB without mission essential contract support. Although the Government anticipated a change in contractor provided service by 1 September 2019, the Government did not anticipate the extenuating circumstances creating the lack of contract support by 1 March 2019. Therefore, the Government is forced to reprocure installation-wide Base Operating Support (BUS) Services immediately. The competitive follow-on contract effort, in progress, will not be in-place for at least 7 months. The loss of contract support resulted in the need for a short-term contract to fulﬁll the mission critical support services required by Wesrover ARB to prevent a shutdown. Without this proposed award. the delay in award of a full and open competitive contract would result in grave damage to the Westover mission. This award will be made to a competent service provider with over IO years of experience on the base. They indicated willingness to perform the shortuterm arrangement via an RF]. This service provider possess the knowledge and resources to provide the required services immediately. Ill. Description of supplies/services required to meet agency needs. This contract is for Base Operations Support (805) Services including Base Supply, Vehicle Operations and Maintenance, Traffic Management, Real Property Maintenance, Fuels Management, and —Thc 505 Services contract includes training for AFRC Reservist. Period of performance will be 1 March - 15 December 2019. With regards to scope of work, only emergemy work orders will be authorized recognizing there is a large backlog of work orders. Backlogged work orders will only be authorized upon becoming emergency due to mission critical needs. IV. Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302—2. Use of this authority is appropriate because any lapse in service or a loss of mission support servlces would shutdown operations at Westover ARB, MA. V. Demonstration that the contractor's unique qualiﬁcations or nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited above (applicability of authority). See paragraph ll above. VI. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable. This is a short-term letter contract that is being solicited on the basis that there is not sufficient time to compete for necessary urgent coverage due to the unexpected lack of contract support. Due to time constraints only one source March20l8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Pagezgfa W FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Justiﬁcation and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition has the capability to meet rnlssron support needs. The anticipated service provrder has actual operational knowledge of the services required to support the base to prevent a lapse of service. Vll. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The cost/price of this contract will be considered Fair and reasonable to the government based upon the receipt of certiﬁed cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR requirements. VIII. Description of the market research conducted and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted. - Market research was not conducted for this effort due to unusual time constraints; however, market research from the most recent competitive effort was reviewed and considered. IX. Any other facts supporting the use of other Than Full and Open Competition. The anticipated service provider is a previous incumbent contractor that has manpoweravailable for immediate placement as well as equipment and materials necessary to perform these mission essential services for Westover ARB. X. List of any sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. _xpressed interest and capability in writing as a result ofan RFI. XI. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before making subsequent acquisitions tor the supplies or services required.

IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVII Y This is a Limited Source Justiﬁcation The requiring activity is United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC), 1562 Mitscher 'Ave Suite 250, Norfolk, VA 23551. The contracting activity is the NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center, Norfolk (FLCN), Contracting Ofﬁce, 1968 Gilbert Street, Suite 600, Norfolk, VA 23511. 2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT ACTION This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Pro gram (Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USS. 25l, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies). This is a limited source action to be awarded as a new General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) order in support of the USFFC. The placement of a Film-Fixed—Price (FFP) order is anticipated. This requirement will he conducted as a sole-source acquisition as only one source is capable of providing the supplies/support required at the level of quality required because the supplies are unique and highly specialized. 3. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SUPPLIES/SERVICES The Ofﬁce of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) N91, N2/N6 and U. S. Fleet Forces Command N022 require a research and advisory subscription that focus on Department of the Navy IT/Data and Analytics mission essential outcomes. OPNAV/USFF does not have organic signiﬁcant and unbiased resources to track ever changing trends/industry capabilities, i.e., have insight in to venous technical solutions or comparison of applicable vendors; analyze impacts of IT/Data and Analytics mandates emerging from the Chief of Naval Operations, Secretary of the Navy, or Department of Defense; and stay up to date on best practices in the ever evolving IT/Data and Analytics industry stemming from prominent commercial sector companies/vendors. This requirement is for yearly a subscription to provide access to the previously provided information above. The speciﬁc subscriptions for this requirement are as follows: The instant requirement for OPNAV is for membership to: One (1) Gather Executive Program Leadership Team — Team Leader One (1) Gartner Executive Program leadership Team ~ Delegate Member One (I) Gartuer Executive Program Leadership Team — Partner Member One (1) Gartner Executive Program Leadership Team — Advisor Member The instant requirement for USFF is'for membership to: One (1) Ganner Executive Program Leadership Team — Partner Member One (1) Gunner Executive Program Leadership Team — Adviser Member The requirement for OPNAV N2/No is for membership to: One (1) Gunner Executive Program Leadership Team — Team Leader Two (2) Gartner Executive Program Leadership Team — Delegate Member Five (5) Gartner Executive Program Leadership Team 7 Advisor Member 4‘ IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE AND/0R DEMONSTRATION 0F CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS The statutory authority which permits restricting consideration of schedule connectors to fewer than that required inFAR 8i405~l or 8.405-2 is 41 U.S.C. 251, as implemented by FAR 8.405-6. Speciﬁcally, the competitive requirement for this procurement is waived based on criteria cited in FAR BAGS-603) (l) — only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of work. . The Government requires a contractor who not only has a Secret facility clearance, but the subscription also has to provide account executives with clearances that are available for conversations and documents reviewed at the same level. Gartrter, Inc. is the only known IT research and advisory company on the GSA schedule 70 vehicle to have aFacilities Clearance. Garmer is the only known provider on the GSA Schedule 70 who employs a full-time Federal Facilities Security Ofﬁcer (FSO). Since2007,Gar-u- :‘ - ‘ - » -: : withintheNa -i — r extensive research and a-v'rsory support an lusrrrcss case an ysrs o ‘ V nusmess process infrastructure. OPNAV and USFF require accuracy, and continuity and commonality in the type of data pulls and . analysis done previously and ongoing. Without this continuity the Navy would incur duplication of effort provided to date and loss of knowledge base for ongoing projects and analysis which could impact the Navy’s mission. Garmer’s analysts perform proprietary research to include iii-depth evaluations on vendors and trends with discrete IT segments including military and commercial sector, which results in their ability to identify 175 “Magic Quadrant” evaluations. According to market research and engagement with industry subject matter experts, Garner’s Magic Quadrauts are regarded as the industry standard and the most comprehensive market segment analysis available, which allows for the acceleration of decision making and planning efforts. Other important proprietary research tools include the Gartner Vendor Score and Gartner IT Scorer Gartner currently provides speciﬁc proprietary technical research and advisory services for implementation level IT/Data and Analytics management along with planning and executive level IT expertise to OPNAV and other Navy Activities. The Garmer Executive Programs . Leadership Team membership will provide continuity of information that no other oﬁferor can provide to OPNAV N91, N2fN6, and USFF via access to a C10 peer network of more than 4,000 0105 worldwide. The OPNAV N91, N2/i\\16, and USFF IT/Data and Analytics leadership will have access to research via. the Gamer website, ability to request both classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed document reviews, tin-site discussion in our Federal secure facility, and the unlimited opportunity to talk with the analysts. Market research was limited to the GSA Schedule for Research and Advisory subscriptions. Market research was conducted via internet sites and consultation with other Navy commands and agencies for the acquisition of research and analysis on information technology, data and analytics, software, communications, and related technology industries. While other sources were identiﬁed, those sources did not have the capability to meet the Government’s requirements for facility clearance, continuity and commonality of research data, and large volume of research and propriety toolkits. Market research showed that only one vendor, Gartner', could provide the subscription needed to ﬁilﬁll the Govemment’s needs. Garmer’s analysts perform in—depﬂi evaluations on vendors and trends within discrete information technology segments. They do not perform IT implementation services and do not sell information technology or produce research on a “sponsored” basis, making them completely objective in their analysis of the market with no partiality to a particular technology, product, tool, or vendor‘»speciﬁc methodology. Below is a list of what Gunner’s subscriptions offer which is unavailable through any other source: 0 Facilities clearance and offers account executives and Executive Partners with clearances for conversations and document reviews on classiﬁed topics. I Access to critical data and proprietary maturity assessments based on the world‘s largest 1T benchmark database. ~ Speciﬁc proprietary research and toolkits written exclusively for the Government on topics surrounding the intersection of IT and business. 0 Access to an online database of more than 120,000 proprietary research documents covering all aspects of IT. No other company on the GSA schedule has the breadth and knowledge that Garmer can provide. Other Facts Supporting J nsﬂﬁcation OPNAV N91, and OPNAV N2/N6 leads need to be able to interact with peers across both government and industry to leverage any best practices and lessons learned in this particular domain. Gartner Executive Programs Leadership Team in the domain of IT and Data and Analytics provides license holders with access to an exclusive network of peers in those roles worldwide. The OPNAV N91 and OPNAV N2/N6 Leads will have access to research via the Gartner website, ability to request both classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed document reviews, on-site discussion in our Federal secure facility, and the unlimited opportunity to talk with the analyst. (tanner, Inc. is the only research and advisory provider that has a dedicated Federal Practice which provides unrnetered access to the entire OPNAV N91, N2/N6, and USF F Enterprise, including classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed environments. Many of (farmer’s 1,900+ subject mamr experts and consultants have secret clearances. Gartner’s unmetered access brings unique insights from the classiﬁed community that would not otherwise be available (e. g. cloud computing in a multi—level environment). Gattner’s access to classiﬁed DOD information enables them to align OPNAV N91, N2/N6, and USFF IT/Data and Analytics strategies with the whole of Government which gives Gartner, Inc, the expertise and appreciation on the IT/Data and Analytics challenges and ﬁscal constraints faced by OPNAV and USFF to develop IT and Data and Analytics programs of tomorrow. As a result, only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of work. 5. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COSTIPRICE The GSA has determined the priced items provided under the schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable for the purpose of establishing the schedule contract. Therefore, ordering activities are responsible to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing for individual orders. Per FAR 3.404 (d) DEVIATION, the NAVSUP FLCN Contracting Ofﬁcer will determine, using the pmcedures in FAR 15.404-1, that the prices are fair and reasonable and will document such determination with a level of detail commensurate with the complexity and circumstances of the anticipated order: 61 DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH The tequirmg activity and contracting activity have conducted market research among schedule holders. Market Research was conducted by the Contracting Ofﬁcer and USFFC to identify existing contracts within the Department of Defense (DoD) to satisfy this effort It was determined that no existing programs are capable of p10v1dmg support required. The Contracting Ofﬁcer along with the‘ customer has determined that Gunner, 1110., is the only contractor capable of prov1d1ng the required services. 7.

Contracting Activig: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Ofﬁce of Procurement Acquisition and Logistics Technology Acquisition Center 23 Christopher Way Eatontown, NJ 07724 2. Description of Action: The proposed action is for award of a Time and Materials (T&M) Task Order (TO) to provide continued professional and technical support sen/ices for the VA Financial Services Center (FSC) which were received under Transformation Twenty One Total Technology (T4) Task Order VA118-13»D-1015 VA118-1015-0042. 3. Description of the Supplies or Services: The VA FSC has a requirement for continued professional and technical support services for the FSC Financial Technology Sen/ice (FTS), formerly the information Technology Service, and its subdivisions. Speciﬁcally, under this proposed effort, the Contractor shall continue to provide services to support the IT infrastructure, operations, FSC projects, and various initiatives supported by FSC, on behalf of VA, and Other Government Agencies (OGAs). Further, the Contractor shall provide support services, and develop deliverables, for FSC software projects including new software projects, maintenance releases, and emergency software releases. The Contractor shall produce deliverables that align with the VeteransAFocused Integration Process (VIP). The Contractor shall perform resource planning in support of existing systems and applications, new software projects, maintenance releases, and emergency software releases. The Contractor shall manage resource levels and coordinate with FSC Project Managers to understand schedule timelines. The current T4 Task Order is set to expire on March 16, 2019, and cannot be extended as the T4 Contract Ordering Period has expired. Under the T4 Task Order, a requirement was included for transition support. Given the timeline that the new competed order would be awarded, this Optional Task cannot be exercised under the T4 Task Order as originally planned due to the limitations described in Section 5 of this Justiﬁcation. Therefore, as part of this effort, an Optional Task for transition support must be included. The period of performance for this proposed Task Order shall be 30 da 5 for continued service and one 1 30-da O i n transition su art. 4, Statutom Authorig: The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 USC. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled “Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized“. 5. Rationale Supportm Use ofAuthgity Cited Above: The proposed source is Pro- Sphere, Tek (Pro-Sphere), 433 N Lee Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-2301. The original T0 was competed and Pro-Sphere was the successful awardee. No other source, > other than Pro-Sphere, is able to meet the Government‘s technical and timeliness requirements as documented below. FSC FTS Support Bridge Control Number TAO—1964941 The VA FSC FTS provides IT infrastructure support, software engineering, including system and data, Architecture, Electronic Commerce (EC)/Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) (EC/EDI), Information Assurance, and system and database support services to the FSC in support of the FSC's overall mission of providing high-quality financial services. Under the existing T4 T0, Pro-Sphere provides on-site professional services to support the FSC FTS and its Divisions and Branches that fall beneath it, as well as OGA's to support these functions and ensure that the FSC Infrastructure is running efficiently. The existing T0 is set to expire on March 16, 2019. An acquisition package was submitted on November 28, 2018 to recompete the effort and establish a new T0 in time to ensure no breaks in service. However, on January 7, 2019, the Ofﬁce of Information and Technology (OI&T) released an updated Cloud policy entitled \"Use of VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) for New Developments (VIEWS 00124536)\", The updated Cloud policy was required to capture emerging Agency requirements for Cloud Computing, required to reduce VA’s IT infrastructure footprint. Immediately upon becoming aware of the updated policy, FSC required signiﬁcant revisions to its requirements documentation for the FSC FTS acquisition in order to become compliant. For example, FSC had to ensure that all the applications that required the aforementioned professional and technical support services be evaluated by Cloud engineers to determine their readiness for transition to the VAEC. In addition, FSC had to ensure that any new applications are properly engineered for intake and hosting in the VAEC. This unanticpated need to revise VA’s requirements and update the existing acquisition package caused a signiﬁcant delay in the release of the solicitation which has subsequently shifted the anticipated award date for the new TO to at least one month after the current TO expires. As a result of this delay, there will be a break in service of the required professional and technical support services unless a short-term sole source T0 is awarded to the incumbent, Pro-Sphere, to continue services until the new T0 is awarded. VA cannot afford any breaks in service for this support, as it would cause signiﬁcant harm to both the Agency, and ultimately the Veteran. Further, a lapse in service creates intolerable risk because the FSC wouldn’t have the necessary technical resources to sustain the ﬁnancial Technology infrastructure. Further, this would have signiﬁcant impact on VA‘s ability to process required activities such as Veteran Healthcare Claims, payroll for VA employees, or payment of invoices for outstanding VA contractual obligations. Based on Market Research, described in Section 8 of this Justification, no other source, other than Pro-Sphere, has the capability to provide the necessary resources within the Government’s timetable to avoid a break in service, Specifically, the Government estimates that it would take another source a minimum of 30 days to commence onboarding resources and start transitioning work, Specifically, to start transitioning work, any Contractor must provide assistance with the development of plans, procedures and methods for assumption of all on-going work. Further, it would take another 30 days for any new source to be able to provide meaningful and necessary support, without a transition period. Therefore, it is estimated that it would take a 20f5 FSC FTS Support Bridge Control Number TAG-1964941 minimum of 60 days for a new source to fully staff and begin performing at the required level to fully support the VA FSC infrastructure, operations, FSC projects, and various initiatives supported by FSC. These estimates are based on historical information; speciﬁcally, the timeframe that the incumbent contractor took to be staffed and onboarded when TO VA118-13-D-1015 VA118-1015-0042 was awarded. Given the time-sensitive nature of this requirement, as well as signiﬁcant risk of a break in services, only the intended source, Pro-Sphere, has the ability to meet the Government‘s need. VA cannot afford any breaks in service for this support, as it would cause signiﬁcant harm to both the Agency, and ultimately the Veteran. Further, a lapse in service creates intolerable risk because the FSC wouldn't have the necessary technical resources to sustain the Financial Technology infrastructure. Further, this would have signiﬁcant impact on VA’s ability to process required activities such as Veteran Healthcare Claims, payroll for VA employees, or payment of invoices for outstanding VA contractual obligations. These business processes which are being supported under this effort have a direct impact on the VA's ability to provide healthcare and medical services to the Veteran, and thereby have signiﬁcant impact on patient safety 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document. This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government’s requirements. There is no competition anticipated for this speciﬁc acquisition.

The justiﬁcation for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is based on the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303~2 as follows: 1. Agency and Contracting Activity The US. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Detroit Field Office and the Ofﬁce of Acquisition Management (OAQ) Detention, Compliance and Removals Division (DCR) proposes to extend Contract HSCEDM- 17-D-00001 on a basis of other than full and open competition. 2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved (:1) Type of action: Extension of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indeﬁnite Delivery Indefmite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract HSCEDM-17-D-00001 (b) Amount of Current J&A: $20,504,709.68 (Funds will be obligated under Task Orders) (c) Brief Description: OAQ has a requirement to continue, on a sole source basis, detention and transportation services at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center (NEOCC) in Youngstown, Ohio. The current contractor for these services is the following: CoreCivic 10 Burton Hills Blvd Nashville, TN 37215 3. Description of Supplies/Services CoreCivic provides full time detention and transportation services at NEOCC in Youngstown, Ohio for approximately 352 ICE detainees. Services include detention management, custodial supervision, case management, transfers to various areas of responsibility, foreign removals, premium medical care, onsite hearings and asylum services. NEOCC is located close to the Ohio Turnpike in Mahoning County, Ohio, which allows for quick bus transportation of detainees between the facility and others located in the Field Ofﬁce’s Area of Responsibility (AOR). Services are provided in compliance with the ICE 2011 Performance Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS 2011), American Correctional Association (ACA) Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities (ALDF), Standards for Health Services in Jails, National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC), and other state and local laws on ﬁrearms. OFFICE OF ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT Justiﬁcation For Other Than Full And Open Competition 41 U.S.C. 3304 J&A-19-0029 The estimated value of this action is $0,504,709.68. 4. Identiﬁcation of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. § 3304 (a)(1), as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. 5. Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition require use of the authority cited. CoreCivic was awarded contract HSCEDM-17-D-00001 on December 14. 2016 to provide detention services at NEOCC for the surge of illegal aliens crossing the Southwest border. CoreCivic is currently the only source readily available that possess the requisite qualiﬁed facility and personnel that can provide detention, care, and removal services for approximately 350 ICE detainees within the Detroit Area of Responsibility (AOR) in accordance with ICE standards. Delaying this extension would require ICE to relocate detainees to other AORs, some with serious medical conditions, only to be relocated again once additional bed space is available or a new contract is awarded. This could result in serious injury to the detainees. Approval of the proposed extension ensures the uninterrupted continuity of services by allowing ICE to continue to detain, provide care for and remove aliens. 6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. County jails in the Detroit AOR and industry service providers were contacted to gauge interest and availability from the market place; however, no interested party was found that could provide services for 352 detainees at this time, except for CoreCivic. In an effort to procure detention services through full and open competition, the Government issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) on January 28, 2019 and intends to award an IDIQ contract for up to 600 detention beds in the Detroit AOR. Due to NEPA requirements, the period of performance is not expected to begin until 2021. 7. Determination by the Contracting Ofﬁcer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will be Fair and Reasonable The Contracting Ofﬁcer has determined that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable, as the extension is based on the current pricing, which was determined to be fair and reasonable at contract award. The most recent Department and Labor Wage OFFICE OF ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT Justiﬁcation For Other Than Full And Open Competition 41 U.S.C. 3304 1&A- 19-0029 Determination issued in December of 201 8 that covers the majority of the effort performed will be incorporated, 8. Description of Market Research The Detroit Field Ofﬁce solicited several private industry providers as well as the county jails that currently hold ICE detainees; however, with the exception of CoreCivic, no party was found to meet this immediate requirement. A few entities are interested in submitting a proposal to the impending RFP to provide services with a period of performance commencement date of 2021‘ 9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition Not Applicable. 10. A Listing of the Sources, if any, that expressed in writing an Interest in the Acquisition CoreCivic is the only source that expressed an interest in performing this immediate requirement. A few county jails and private industry providers are interested in submitting a proposal in response to the RFP to provide services in the future. 11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required ERO and OAQ have worked collaboratively to complete the Market Research, Acquisition Plan, and Performance Work Statement for the RFP that was posted on January 28, 2019. The RFP allows sufﬁcient time for a new facility to be constructed, or an existing facility to be renovated in the Detroit AOR, which will increase competition for detention services in the Detroit AOR for the future procurement. 12.

The contracting activity is the NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center, Norfolk (FLCN), Contracting Ofﬁce, 1968 Gilbert Street, Suite 600, Norfolk, VA 23511. 2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT ACTION This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Pro gram (Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USS. 25l, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies). This is a limited source action to be awarded as a new General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) order in support of the USFFC. The placement of a Film-Fixed—Price (FFP) order is anticipated. This requirement will he conducted as a sole-source acquisition as only one source is capable of providing the supplies/support required at the level of quality required because the supplies are unique and highly specialized. 3. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SUPPLIES/SERVICES The Ofﬁce of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) N91, N2/N6 and U. S. Fleet Forces Command N022 require a research and advisory subscription that focus on Department of the Navy IT/Data and Analytics mission essential outcomes. OPNAV/USFF does not have organic signiﬁcant and unbiased resources to track ever changing trends/industry capabilities, i.e., have insight in to venous technical solutions or comparison of applicable vendors; analyze impacts of IT/Data and Analytics mandates emerging from the Chief of Naval Operations, Secretary of the Navy, or Department of Defense; and stay up to date on best practices in the ever evolving IT/Data and Analytics industry stemming from prominent commercial sector companies/vendors. This requirement is for yearly a subscription to provide access to the previously provided information above. The speciﬁc subscriptions for this requirement are as follows: The instant requirement for OPNAV is for membership to: One (1) Gather Executive Program Leadership Team — Team Leader One (1) Gartner Executive Program leadership Team ~ Delegate Member One (I) Gartuer Executive Program Leadership Team — Partner Member One (1) Gartner Executive Program Leadership Team — Advisor Member The instant requirement for USFF is'for membership to: One (1) Ganner Executive Program Leadership Team — Partner Member One (1) Gunner Executive Program Leadership Team — Adviser Member The requirement for OPNAV N2/No is for membership to: One (1) Gunner Executive Program Leadership Team — Team Leader Two (2) Gartner Executive Program Leadership Team — Delegate Member Five (5) Gartner Executive Program Leadership Team 7 Advisor Member 4‘ IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE AND/0R DEMONSTRATION 0F CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS The statutory authority which permits restricting consideration of schedule connectors to fewer than that required inFAR 8i405~l or 8.405-2 is 41 U.S.C. 251, as implemented by FAR 8.405-6. Speciﬁcally, the competitive requirement for this procurement is waived based on criteria cited in FAR BAGS-603) (l) — only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of work. . The Government requires a contractor who not only has a Secret facility clearance, but the subscription also has to provide account executives with clearances that are available for conversations and documents reviewed at the same level. Gartrter, Inc. is the only known IT research and advisory company on the GSA schedule 70 vehicle to have aFacilities Clearance. Garmer is the only known provider on the GSA Schedule 70 who employs a full-time Federal Facilities Security Ofﬁcer (FSO). Since2007,Gar-u- :‘ - ‘ - » -: : withintheNa -i — r extensive research and a-v'rsory support an lusrrrcss case an ysrs o ‘ V nusmess process infrastructure. OPNAV and USFF require accuracy, and continuity and commonality in the type of data pulls and . analysis done previously and ongoing. Without this continuity the Navy would incur duplication of effort provided to date and loss of knowledge base for ongoing projects and analysis which could impact the Navy’s mission. Garmer’s analysts perform proprietary research to include iii-depth evaluations on vendors and trends with discrete IT segments including military and commercial sector, which results in their ability to identify 175 “Magic Quadrant” evaluations. According to market research and engagement with industry subject matter experts, Garner’s Magic Quadrauts are regarded as the industry standard and the most comprehensive market segment analysis available, which allows for the acceleration of decision making and planning efforts. Other important proprietary research tools include the Gartner Vendor Score and Gartner IT Scorer Gartner currently provides speciﬁc proprietary technical research and advisory services for implementation level IT/Data and Analytics management along with planning and executive level IT expertise to OPNAV and other Navy Activities. The Garmer Executive Programs . Leadership Team membership will provide continuity of information that no other oﬁferor can provide to OPNAV N91, N2fN6, and USFF via access to a C10 peer network of more than 4,000 0105 worldwide. The OPNAV N91, N2/i\\16, and USFF IT/Data and Analytics leadership will have access to research via. the Gamer website, ability to request both classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed document reviews, tin-site discussion in our Federal secure facility, and the unlimited opportunity to talk with the analysts. Market research was limited to the GSA Schedule for Research and Advisory subscriptions. Market research was conducted via internet sites and consultation with other Navy commands and agencies for the acquisition of research and analysis on information technology, data and analytics, software, communications, and related technology industries. While other sources were identiﬁed, those sources did not have the capability to meet the Government’s requirements for facility clearance, continuity and commonality of research data, and large volume of research and propriety toolkits. Market research showed that only one vendor, Gartner', could provide the subscription needed to ﬁilﬁll the Govemment’s needs. Garmer’s analysts perform in—depﬂi evaluations on vendors and trends within discrete information technology segments. They do not perform IT implementation services and do not sell information technology or produce research on a “sponsored” basis, making them completely objective in their analysis of the market with no partiality to a particular technology, product, tool, or vendor‘»speciﬁc methodology. Below is a list of what Gunner’s subscriptions offer which is unavailable through any other source: 0 Facilities clearance and offers account executives and Executive Partners with clearances for conversations and document reviews on classiﬁed topics. I Access to critical data and proprietary maturity assessments based on the world‘s largest 1T benchmark database. ~ Speciﬁc proprietary research and toolkits written exclusively for the Government on topics surrounding the intersection of IT and business. 0 Access to an online database of more than 120,000 proprietary research documents covering all aspects of IT. No other company on the GSA schedule has the breadth and knowledge that Garmer can provide. Other Facts Supporting J nsﬂﬁcation OPNAV N91, and OPNAV N2/N6 leads need to be able to interact with peers across both government and industry to leverage any best practices and lessons learned in this particular domain. Gartner Executive Programs Leadership Team in the domain of IT and Data and Analytics provides license holders with access to an exclusive network of peers in those roles worldwide. The OPNAV N91 and OPNAV N2/N6 Leads will have access to research via the Gartner website, ability to request both classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed document reviews, on-site discussion in our Federal secure facility, and the unlimited opportunity to talk with the analyst. (tanner, Inc. is the only research and advisory provider that has a dedicated Federal Practice which provides unrnetered access to the entire OPNAV N91, N2/N6, and USF F Enterprise, including classiﬁed and unclassiﬁed environments. Many of (farmer’s 1,900+ subject mamr experts and consultants have secret clearances. Gartner’s unmetered access brings unique insights from the classiﬁed community that would not otherwise be available (e. g. cloud computing in a multi—level environment). Gattner’s access to classiﬁed DOD information enables them to align OPNAV N91, N2/N6, and USFF IT/Data and Analytics strategies with the whole of Government which gives Gartner, Inc, the expertise and appreciation on the IT/Data and Analytics challenges and ﬁscal constraints faced by OPNAV and USFF to develop IT and Data and Analytics programs of tomorrow. As a result, only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of work. 5. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COSTIPRICE The GSA has determined the priced items provided under the schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable for the purpose of establishing the schedule contract. Therefore, ordering activities are responsible to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing for individual orders. Per FAR 3.404 (d) DEVIATION, the NAVSUP FLCN Contracting Ofﬁcer will determine, using the pmcedures in FAR 15.404-1, that the prices are fair and reasonable and will document such determination with a level of detail commensurate with the complexity and circumstances of the anticipated order: 61 DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH The tequirmg activity and contracting activity have conducted market research among schedule holders. Market Research was conducted by the Contracting Ofﬁcer and USFFC to identify existing contracts within the Department of Defense (DoD) to satisfy this effort It was determined that no existing programs are capable of p10v1dmg support required. The Contracting Ofﬁcer along with the‘ customer has determined that Gunner, 1110., is the only contractor capable of prov1d1ng the required services. 7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS This procurement utilizes a GSA Schedule and will be solicited and awarded in accordance with FAR Subpait 8 4. 8.

Bureau of the Census, National Processing Center (NPC). It Is prepared and submitted by the NFC Procurement Otﬁce. 2. Nature of The A ﬁrm to A raved The acquisition being contemplated is by task order against Federal Supply Schedule 70, SIN132-32, contract number GS-35F-0029Y and is to he conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (see FAR 8.401). NPC seeks approval of this Limited-Sources Justiﬁcation under the authority of FAR Part 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) as a logical follow-on to the original order Y81323-13-NC-0279. The original order was not issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures. The original order was executed in accordance with the FAR 8.405 Ordering Procedures; speciﬁcally requirement Y81323-13—RP-0009 was posted to GSA eBuy under RFQ # 81 9953. 3. rl ' i 'r The services required are a follow—on procurement of the Census Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS) an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The system is delivered in a cloud-based, custom-conﬁgured Software-as-avSenrice application suite. The application has received Authority to Operate (ATO) according to Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) criteria. The services are now identiﬁed, as Part Number TAG—SYT—SAAS-SaCU-1 00 in GSA Schedule 70 Contract Number GS—35F-0029Y.The cost of these services available as licenses for 100 user accounts with 33 concurrent users for one year from date of award is $1,128,205.40. The cost of these seNices for an option year beginning at the Page! ofs conclusion of the base year is $1.182.000.00. If necessary. the cost of continuing these services for an additional six (6) months is 562055000 4. r' a u o n Rationale Authority tor this Linited Sources acquisition is FAR B.4D§-B(a)(1)(i)(C), a logical follow- on to the original order. The original order was not issued under sole-source or limited- sources procedures. Multiple award fair opportunity was given by solicitation number YB1323-13—RP-0009, posted to GSA eBuy under RFO# 819953. It is in the interest of economy and etﬁciency to continue this acquisition of a customized application and platform of Syteline through Software-as—a Service (SaaS) subscription service from The Arcanum Group (TAG). TAG staff is very familiar with the Census National Processing Center and Bureau of Census staff. with current BOG/NFC business processes. and the conﬁguration work already completed on ILMS as it currently operates at Census. There is signiﬁcant time advantage in conducting the work going forward based on TAG‘s intimate knowledge of our current business process conﬁgurations. Signiﬁcant. as well. Is that TAG is an Authorized Infor Federal Partner, which allords TAG with coveted lnfor technlcai support for resolving issues as they anse. The Census Bureau ls in its most intense period of operations. The Decennial Census and ongoing data collection efforts have consuned any time available for research. qualiﬁcation and implemenhtion of a new ILMS system. The use of other software would result In substantial duplication of implementation, training. veriﬁcation costs and unacceptable delays in fulﬁlling agency requirements. Estimated government labor costs associated with new implementation. training and testing of any other solution will exceed 1,350 supervisor. manager and SME hours in the ﬁrst 6 months: and then another 300-500 hours in staft training and transition activities. The personnel required for such an alfort are simply not available during Decennial Census build out and execution. Conducting the Decenniai Census and other data collection activities are mandated by law and cannot be jeopardized. The Census Bureau must delay competition for this requirement until Deoennial Census operations are past peak in the Fall of 2020. Approval to operate any system requires Authority to Operate (ATO) approval. There is not adequate time to quality a new system for operation during peak Decennial Census Operations. FedRAMP requirements for ERP systems are substantial and time consuming. According to the GSA FedRAMP Project Management Ofﬁce. obtaining ATO certiﬁcation takes 12 to 24 months and is also affected by Census Oiﬁce of information Security limitations. All three system layers or elements of the stack (infrastructure. platform. software] application) must be ATO certiﬁed. All system components must be blended and integrated with processes linking it to other system components in a seamless approach. The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) must have internal policy and procedure docun'lentation that addresses how the system is monitored, administered and controlled, where responsibilities lie and applicable Page: ors management criteria. A third party assessment organization (SPAO) must be hired to provide independent review of the entire system and verify that the proposed system is delivered and complies with FedRAMP criteria. The package submission includes signiﬁcant documentation of direct response to individual controls with detailed descriptions of processes involved. lntemal documentation is also required. There no reason to believe a fast track FedRAMP evaluation could be completed on a new system and Govemment use certiﬁed before late 2020 or early 2021. 5. 0 tin fﬁc 'e termination The Contracting Ofﬁcer requested discounts from the GSA Schedule Contract number GS—35F-0029Y prices offered by Arcanum and obtained a discount of 7.8% for the services required. in accordance with FAR 8.404(d). the offered price is fair and reasonable and represents the best value. 6. Market Research The original order, YB1323-13—NC-0279, was procured under FAR Subpart 8.4 using unrestricted \"Fair Opportunity\" to Schedule 70 contract holders. An RFQ was posted to GSA eBuy under RFQ number RFOB19953. Only two (2) contract holders responded to the initial RFQ. and only The Arcanum Group provided a responsive quote and reasonable solution to the requirement. Efforts for the current ILMS system began in April 2013, and did not go live until mid- 2015. Preliminary costs for user collaboration in design. requirements deﬁnition and process development, and training exceeded $300.000.00. Many of these eﬁons are lirely to be required for any replacement system at a similar cost According to the GSA Fed RAMP Project Management Ofﬁce. obtaining ATO certiﬁcation takes 12 to 24 months. This is highly variable due to frequent changes in ATO criteria, speciﬁc controls and required modiﬁcations, as well as limited resources available within government and from commercial information security service providers sewing as a third-party assessment organization. if a software vendor (Cloud Service Provider or CSP) Is not familiar with FedRAMP criteria, it may seriously underestimate expense and level of effort required to obtain ATO. All three system layers or elements of the stack (infrastructure, platform. soltwarel application) must be Included. Even ifa part of the system is certiﬁed, it must be blended and integrated with processes linking it to other system components in a seamless approach. A third-party assessment organization (SPAO) must be hired by the vendor to provide independent review of the entire system and verify that everything promised is delivered and complies with FedRAMP criteria. The package submission is lengthy and must provide response to individual controls with detailed descriptions of processes involved. internal documentation is also required. Experience obtaining the current ILMS ATO is 13 to 36 months. Page 3 of5 Given justiﬁcation above, known mix of actual and expected demands and responsibilities, ﬁnding. validating, selecting and collaborating with application/source is not feasible or supportable untll Decennial Census Logistics Operations have past peak eﬁort periods. Market research charts were continued in 2016 and again in 2018. The ﬁndings in 2016 were that no other sources were available through the Federal Supply Schedule contracts to provide the required services and licensing for the ILMS system. Market research in 2018 revealed that some parts of the ILMS system might be avallahle from through other sources. Actual usage data and operational results obtained during Decennial Census operations may reveal a simpliﬁed inventory management system can be used. Many options are currently available for simpliﬁed inventory management systems. Additional concerns are presented by the relocation of the National Processing Center (NFC) before the fall of 2021. The physical characteristics of a new facility such as ceiling and storage rack height can affect ILMS functions and are not yet available. Necessary details regarding the new facility should be available in 2020. it is in the best interest of the Census Bureau to delay re—competition of the current ILMS system until aﬂer Decennial Census operations are past peak and the details of NPC relocation are available. 7. Agency Actions Contemplated to Remove Barriers to Competition The agency intends to reﬁne the requirement based on actual usage data and operational results obtained during the Decennial Census. and issue a request for quote for the reﬁned requirement through the GSA eBuy System in the Fall of 2020. 8.

P0P: 15 APR 23 to 14 APR 24 Maximum Pagei 012 Single Source Justi cation (Simpli ed Acquisr 'on) Section C: Justiﬁcation for Soli tlng from a Single Source or Brand Name Requirement is to utilize the vendor authorized to maintain the existing Securadyne installed security system/ hardware conﬁguration to ensure functionality across the unit's unique security suite. Systems within Bldg. 73 are integrated and fully operational with systems in Bldg. 85. Although the software itself is not proprietary, the programming, integration. and design of the security suite is exclusive to Securadyne and service by any other vendor would void the systems currently under warranty until 2020. The proposed vendor has in—depth knowledge of the security suite providing for continuity and rapid response to any issues that arise. The 96 CI' G requires rapid emergency response 24/7 to ensure the critical security suite remains operational. The proposed vendor has the capability to meet response times and the inrdepth knowledge of the integrated security suite to provide rapid onesite emergency services preventing security disruptions and mission stoppage. Procuring an annual maintenance service to ensure the longevity and functionality of the current infuse security system presents the best value to the government versus replacing the system. which is estimated to cost in excess 0 . Not having this vital service would lead to an unacceptable delay and disruption to the mission. Section D: Efforts to Obtain Competition Market research conducted for this acquisition included GSA Advantage and Internet searches. The Government was unable to identify alternative maintenance services for the existing equipment/configuration. Utilizing an alternative vendor would require replacement of the entire system. It was determined by checking product costs that to replace the total system was signiﬁcantly above and beyond the cost to continue with the existing system maintenance vendor. To replace or introduce a new system conﬁguration verses utilizing the original vendor product conﬁguration would present ssues resulting in higher cost to the government and potential delays to mission success due to compatibility/Interoperab among varying systems. Section E: Steps to Preclude Future Single Source or Brand Name Awards The 96 Cl' G will continue monitoring the industry through trade journals. technical symposia, and contact with industry representatives should a future requirement arise. At this time, the proposed vendor is the only authorized vendor, to use an unauthorized vendor would void manufacturer warranty coverage for the existing system and would cost the government substantially for standalone noncompatible systems This solution provides the government the best value and lowest cost. The government continually reviews options to meet safety and security compliance to determine if new technology is more cost effective than the existing in use system. The government also conducts market research to locate vendors who may produce a more cost effective quality solution to meet the government minimum requirements. Section F: Contracting Ofﬁcer's Determination l have determined. in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 bk 1), that the circumstances of this contract action deem only a single source is reasonably available.

Description of Supplies/Services: ADVANTOR Systems Corporation (ASC) provides for the installation of Intrusion Detection system (IDS) within the Korea Theater of Operations (KTO). The Contractor will maintain currently installed Advantor ASN 6.2 Commercial Intrusion Detection System on US Army Garrison in the Republic of Korea and within Sensitive Companmented Information Facilities (SCIFs).

Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. p FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C). In the interest of economy and efﬁciency, the new work is a ogical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA was not previously issued under a sole-source or limited-sources procedures. FAR 8.405-6(b)(1). Items peculiar to one manufacturer. An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand name, product, ora feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer. A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer. 5. Reason for Authority Cited: Substantial duplication of time and effort to the government is expected for competing the requirement against Advantor Systems Corporation (ASC). ASC designs and manufactures its own system, There is no other certiﬁed source with the complete technical knowledge for Advantor Systems installation. There are only limited data rights given to Government procurement of Advantor Systems, and these rights allow only for single site use and a copy for back up. The End User License agreement for Advantor Software and Firmware is proprietary and conveyed to the Government with limited rights at time of purchase. Allowing others to perform the services would violate that agreement, To maintain the warranty of the installed Advantor Systems equipment in the existing locations. Advantor mandates that only certiﬁed Advantor technicians can work on the system, Advantor provides technical training and certiﬁcation only to individuals that work for their ﬁrm, and they do not use distributors. As there are no ﬁrms capable of providing certiﬁed technicians. Advantor is the only source capable of providing the 24x7 call center monitoring service, emergency repair service, preventative maintenance, parts, and training IMCOM-Paciﬁc (Korea) Directorates of Emergency Services and select units under 5‘\" Army utilize existing Advantor Systems to monitor access control, to detect intrusion at secure facilities, and to notify response forces. Only ASC's technicians have the technical knowledge compatible with the systems in use throughout lMCOM-Paciﬁc and 8‘\" Army access control and alarm monitoring of areas covered under the requested contract. ASC access control and intmsion detection system services installation and maintenance is provided exclusively through Advantor Systems Corporation. The acceptable requirement for compatible equipment and manufacturer-certified installation and maintenance can only be met through Advantor Systems Corporation. United States Forces Korea (USFK) J2 and Eighth United States Army (8A) G2 operate Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facilities (SClFs) at various installations on the Korean Peninsula. These facilities are accredited by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). DIA accreditation requires use of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) compliant with Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 705. Advantor’s software—based IDS annunciator capability, which has been speciﬁcally developed and enhanced to comply with the requirements of AR 190-11; Version — September 2018 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Control No: 19-48 Contractor: Advantor Systems Corporation Program/Equipment: Existing ESS Maintenance Service AR 380-5; AFI 31-101; as well as ICD 705. Advantor Systems Corporation ESS equipment fully complies with the above regulations. For security reasons, all Advantor software and communication protocols are proprietary to Advantor Systems Corporation. No other brand nor manufacturers may interfere with (or integrate with) the Advantor system. Advantor components: The proprietary protocol provides the level of security necessary to comply with both ICD 705 and DA requirements. Failure to provide the required maintenance support for the IDS to meet the requirements of ICD 705 will result in de-accreditation of the SCIFS and subsequent mission failure. IAW AR 190-13, paragraph 9.2. HQDA centrally plans IDS replacement based on asset criticality and system age. The IDS will be replaced on a 10-year life cycle to the greatest extent possible and continuously sustained. The current Advantor ASN 6.2 is not within the 10 year life cycle replacement limits and cost of replacing this system at this time is not ﬁscally feasible. 6. Actions to Increase Competition: On the basis of Iacts described in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, the Government does not envision any change. which would have an impact on the Brand Name nature of this acquisition. Therefore, no action is taken to increase competition for this particular requirement. 7. Market Research: A review was conducted of other GSA Schedules in FSC Group 63, Part 1 Miscellaneous Alarms and Signal Systems Prices were determined to be comparable to similar products offered by other schedule holders However, Advantor products and services are available through Advantor System Corp (ASC)'s GSA Federal Supply Schedule GS-07F-87850. There are no independent dealers or distributors of Advantor products Advantor is the only manufacturer for compatible equipment and the necessary manufacturer-certiﬁed technical expertise to install the system ASC operates a cleared facility and can provide US Citizens to install and integrate the components as required for this effort 8.

Q) Supplies or services being procured: This procurement is for the purchase ofForcepoint Soﬁware, Hardware and Professional Support Services along with Redl-Iat licenses FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE - SOURCE SELECTION SENSITIVE » i (4) Statutory Authority Permitting Sole Source — Brand Name: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is title 41 U.S.C.

(ﬁ) Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authorit : i.e.,_proposed contractor's nniggre qualiﬁcations, etc): The Department of Defense (DOD) mandated Insider Threat program has stringent user access monitoring (UAM) requirements detailed in National Security Systems Directive (CNSSD) 504. The requirements call for the capabilities to collect user activity data. The system capability should incorporate key stroke monitoring and full application content (e.g., email, chat, data import, data export), obtain screen captures, and perform ﬁle shadowing for all lawful purposes UAM data must be attributable to a speciﬁc user. The system should incorporate this data into an analysis system capable of identifying anomalous behavior that may provide indications of insider threat activity and support investigative requests, UAM collection shall be accomplished by the system through the implementation of triggers that monitor user activities on a network. Triggers are a set of logic statements to be applied to a data stream that produces an alert when an anomalous incident or behavior occurs. Forcepoint and RedHat brand products are the market leader and pioneer in the performance of UAM, The product is speciﬁcally designed to meet all CNSSD 504 requirements in an efﬁcient and non-disrupu‘ve manner. These brand name products are the only user activity monitoring solution that meets Intelligence Community (1CD 503 and 13ch 6/3) and DOD (DISA STIGs and DIACAP) security requirements out-of-the box and has Authority to Operate (ATO) in multiple classiﬁed environments. Additionally this solution is frilly validated with NIST FIPS 140-2 encryption. Compliance with the above deployment standards is mandatory for deployment within classiﬁed environments. No outer brand was found that meets all of the Agency’s requirements. (3) Market snrvev (Indicate it' any other firms were contacted or exprased interest): Market research determined that F orcepoint is exclusive owner of the soﬁware product. This requirement will he acquired via a FAR Part 13 Open Market solicitation. ﬂ) Technical rcguirements personnel certiﬁcation: [hereby certify that thisjustiﬁcation is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I would not be making this request if it were feasible to frilly compete this requirement.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. 10 U.S.C. 2304(cX1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) was the OEM of the AV-EB. MDC merged with the Boeing Company (Boeing) in 1997 making Boeing the prime contractor for all AV-SB 1&A Number: 17-0439 production aircraﬂ. The USG possesses only limited rights to data necessary to integrate AIM- 9X and Satellite Communications into the aircraft and only Boeing has the essential system integration expertise and aircraﬁ performance knowledge necessary for maintaining, upgrading, or adding new capabilities. As the sole developer and manufacturer, Boeing is the only ﬁrm to possess the requisite knowledge of the AV-SBs engineering design, soﬁware development for the tactical soﬁware, integration of ﬁmction improvements, and new weapons upgrades. The estimate cost associated with developing another source to meet agency requirements would be substantial and delays associated with developing another source are unacceptable. The current value for the USMC AV-XB aircraft is approximately $30 million dollars which represents the estimated costs that an independent party would need to execute the mission set. Notwiﬂistanding the aireraﬁ cost, is the cost for the technical data pacicagc to include the drawings. data rights, and technical expertise associated with this mission set which cannot be adequately deﬁned in dollar value as this program is near its end of operational life cycle with the Joint Strike Fighter replacing the AV-SB capability in the near future. As stated herein, this estimated duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition consistent with FAR 6.302(a)(2)(ii)(A). 6. Description of Eﬁ‘orts Made to Soilcit Offers from as Many Offerors as Pracﬁcahie In accordance with DFARS PGI 206302-101), 8 Sources Sought announcement we! posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on 06 March 2017. No responses were received. In accordance with FAR 5 2010))(1), the proposed contract was synopsized on the FEDBIZOPS website on 09 March 2017 and no responses or inquiries were received. No additional market research was conducted because it is not practicable, for the reasons discussed in paragraph 5 above, for any company other than The Boning Company to provide the required supplies and services. 7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Ofﬁcer shall ensure that all supplies and services provided under this connect are procured at a fair and reasonable price. The Contractor will submit a formal price proposal with certiﬁed cost or pricing data and sufficient information to support the accuracy and reliability of the estimate. The Boeing Company’s proposal will be reviewed by experienced technical analysts, cost analysts and contract specialists with the aid of necessary ﬁeld pricing support. The Contracting Ofﬁcer will utilize coat and price analysis as the basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price. 8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition. For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NAVAIR has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the types of supplies/services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NAVAlR will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. Because this effort is a follow-on for supplies and services previously awarded on a non- competitive basis, in accordance with DFARS PGI 206.304(a)(i), the prior J&A was provided to the approval authority for review. Approval of this J&A signiﬁes the approval authority has made the determination required by DFARS PGI 206.304(a)(ii)."}

A single award task order contract (SATOC), with a base year and four (4) option years, is estimated at a total contract value of $4,75M, This is a follow-on contract to W9132V—16-C—0005 for the continued provision of highly specialized operations research, development, enhancement, operational capability demonstration and training of the Sage geospatial tools, The incumbent contract was a stand-alone contract with a total contract value of $724,748.03; period of performance 29 Sep 2016 — 28 Feb 2018i Intended award is to veteran- owned small business concern, Michael Rainey and Associates, Speciﬁcally, this action is for an IDIQ for services to provide continued development, enhancement, and training on the Sage toolsetr Sage is a geospatial suite of software that allows soldiers to create mission plans based on weather and terrain factors. As Army Doctrine changes, the commercial software is updated, and other aspects of the toolset are changed/improved/upgraded/enhanced, we need for the toolset to be enhanced, Further, the Sage toolset is continually being trained to soldiers so that they can use it down range Once it's used, the soldiers provide feedback, which is then used to further develop the toolset, It‘s a cycle, and one that Army and several other agencies continue to fund, This procurement is to support on-going and evolving requirements to enhance the Sage Terrain Analysis Tools, henceforth referred to as Sage. Sage is deployed to Army and Special Operations Forces to support mission planning, Based on guidance from the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capability Manager-Foundation (TCM-F), TRADOC Capability Manager-Geospatial (TCM-G), and Program Manager Distributed Common Ground Systemi- Army (PM DCGS-A), and in coordination with Amy Geospatial Center, the Geospatial Research Laboratory (GRL) provides services in support of Sager TCM-F has directed GRL to develop, test, train, and ﬁeld Sage with RDT&E funding from ERDC and PM DCGS-A, 3. Description of Supplies/Services: The Government requires (in-going enhancements to Sage in response to emerging Soldier requirements as directed by PM DCGS-A, Medical Research Materiel Command (MRMC), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and ERDC. An IDIQ will provide the necessary ﬂexibility to address as-yet unknown, emerging soldier requirements, Funded task orders are anticipated to include such tasks and deliverables as, technical documentation, technical exchange meetings, tactical decision aids, operational assessments, instructional material, and training in support of the Sage Toolkit. 5 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLV ERDC Control Log # 18—0155 Justiﬁcation Review Document for Other than Full and Open Competition For a New IDIQ Contract for Sage Geospatial Research and Technical Support a. The primary requiring agency is the PM DCGS-A, Program Executive Ofﬁce Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors, 6002 Combat Drive, Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland 21005-1845. PEO IEW&S develops and integrates sensors and sensor data across multiple technologies ensuring wartighters have a complete understanding of the battleﬁeld. b. A base year and four (4) option years and $4.75M capacity is requested for associated labor, materials, and travel costs to continue the development, enhancement, operational capability demonstration, and training of the Sage. 4. Authority Cited: 10 United States Code 2304(c)(l) as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302—1(a)(2)(iii)(A), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5. Reason for Authority Cited: Michael Rainey and Associates (MRA), LLC is the only responsible source and no other services will satisfy the Government’s requirements. MRA is the original source of the Sage toolkit, and has been the only source to develop, enhance, and train Sage for the Government since it was transitioned from an exclusively research project to a ﬁeld system. This effort represents services that are deemed to be available only from one responsible source since this is a follow-on contract to W9132V-16-C-0005, which expired 28 February 2018, for the continued provision of highly specialized services, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in both substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulﬁlling the agency’s requirements, Sage is a Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) suite of unclassiﬁed, For Ofﬁcial Use Only (FOUO), geospatial tools that were originally developed by ERDC-GRL and George Mason University (GMU) researchers ﬁ‘om ﬁscal year 2011 through 2014, Michael Rainey was one (1) of two (2) retired military ofﬁcers employed as a Research Associate at the GMU Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence (C41) Center. Mr. Rainey was working on and bringing to conclusion, similar concepts to Sage within the Battleﬁeld Terrain Reasoning Awareness (BTRA) and Common Ground programs when ERDC-GRL brought the novel concept of Situational Awareness Geospatially Enabled (SAGE) to them in 2011 for collaboration. Mr, Rainey had been supporting the BTRA and Common Ground research from 2007 — 2011 as a faculty member of the United States Military Academy, Department of Systems Engineering. Subsequently, Mr. Rainey went into business for himself, establishing Michael Rainey and Associates. In 2014, the PM DCGS-A recognized Sage Tools as a critical requirement for immediate Soldier beneﬁt and signed an Authority to Operate Sage Tools on DCGS-A systems, and provided funding for development of technology in order to accelerate the delivery of tools to Soldiers. A Sage Work Agreement is in place between ERDC and PM DCGS-A tbr development, maintenance, and deployment of Sage tools to support current theater operations, Sage is being utilized by the Special Operations Forces to support activities in various theaters around the world. As of FY17, Sage has been deployed to all Arrny divisions. New capabilities continue to be developed to meet the needs of other Agencies in the DOD and the Federal Government. As such, the time associated with a competition, as well as the time that an unfamiliar source would need to assume the incumbent’s role in all things associated with 6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ERDC Control Log # 18-0155 Justiﬁcation Review Document for Other than Full and Open Competition For a New IDIQ Contract for Sage Geospatial Research and Technical Support developing, enhancing, and training Sage would create unacceptable delays in fulﬁlling agency, and more importantly, Soldier needs, This effort is a logical follow-on to W9132V16C0005 and W9132V18P0002 for the continued provision of the highly specialized services necessary to develop, enhance, and train the Sage toolset. MRA is uniquely qualiﬁed to perform these services because of being the only source to have ever developed, enhanced, and trained Sage since its inception. Although the Government has a general requirement, as driven by the needs of the soldiers employing the Sage toolset, there are intrinsic methods to the approach and execution that are specific to MRA as the incumbent contractor of the Sage development and training Thus, it would be impractical for the Government to expect anyone other than the incumbent to be able to leverage the invaluable methods of the predecessor efforts to successfully meet the Government’s needs. MRA possesses an extremely rare skillset of interdisciplinary experience that has culminated into an approach to developing, reﬁning, enhancing, and training Sage that only they can execute. To date, the results of MRA’s efforts are the reason that TCM-F, TCM-G and PM DCGS-A have ﬁelded Sage and continue to fund efforts to improve Sager The more than ten (10) years of experience in both the research leading up to Sage, as well as the direct development of Sage represents time that another source would have to duplicate to some degree, The cost of that cannot be estimated by the Govenmient to any realistic degree, but is anticipated to be substantial enough that the Government could not recover it through competition The following speciﬁcally describes the interdisciplinary nature of MRA’s experience: MRA possesses the ability to link geospatial analytical processes to planning considerations for logical decision—making, which enables MRA to design and develop Soldier centric geo- infonned decision aids as well as implement a unique training methodology for terrain-based mission planning. a) MRA has developed a unique and innovative training concept that applies the theory of Andragogy (Adult Learning Theory) speciﬁcally to the Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) 7—0, Training Units and Developing Leaders, in order to develop competent, conﬁdent, agile, and adaptive leaders, b) MRA has developed a unique and ground-breaking approach that incorporates the use of commercially designed geographic information systems in order to provide combatant commands from Theater to Small Unit Level a more thorough understanding of the operational environment c) MRA possesses the unique intellectual capital to link the geospatial analytical processes to the planning considerations for logical decision—making speciﬁc to Army mission requirements in the design and development of geospatially based tactical decision aids, d) MRA has pioneered the employment of Applied Systems Design and Decision Making, Value Focused Thinking, and Multi-Objective Decision Analysis in the production, operation, and assessment of computer aided algorithms with speciﬁc features essential for the execution of Mission Analysis (MA) and Course of Action (COA) Development within the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP). 7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLV ERDC Control Log # 18-0155 Justification Review Document for Other than Full and Open Competition For a New IDIQ Contract for Sage Geospatial Research and Technical Support e) MRA has developed the intellectual capital for geospatially based tactical decision aids speciﬁcally designed for US Army doctrinal Health Service Support planning. This unique capability provides medical planners with relevant and actionable terrain based decision support tools that enable direction, management, and/or coordination of assigned medical forces, assets, and resources in the accomplishment of assigned missions. f) MRA has developed the intellectual capital to conduct systematic design of experiments within US Army operational units acceptance testing that assess the relationships between contributing factors that affect the process being evaluated and the output of that respective process 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: a. A Notice of Intent to sole source was posted to the Government Point of Entry, via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), on 28 March 2018 with a response date of 27 April 2018. As of the closing date, no responses were received. b. In August 2016 a competitive solicitation, W9132V-16-R—0001, for Sage development, testing, and training services was advertised via FBO as a small business set aside. Market research focused on the broader aspects of the requirement that were related to geospatial soﬁware development. Since Sage is speciﬁc to the Government, it was very difﬁcult to ascertain whether experience existed outside of MRA. At the time, enough information seemed to be available to establish a small business set aside. Two (2) offers, from MRA and Earth Data Inc. partnered with GDTI, were received in response to the solicitation; however, only MRA was deemed technically acceptable for award. Earth Data, Inc. was determined to be technically unacceptable because of their lack of experience in training Sage. 0. Given the nature of the requirements, as delineated in section 3 above, the Government does not anticipate that the prime contractor will have opportunities to subcontract any of the work. 7. Actions to Increase Competition: A synopsis was posted to FBO on 28 March 2018, no responses were received as of the closing date of 27 April 2018. Due to the highly specialized nature of the work, as delineated in section 3 above and demonstrated by the comprehensive skillset necessary to successfully accomplish the work as outlined in section 5 above, actions to increase competition are not feasible at this time. An important aspect of the Government’s on- going efforts regarding the Sage toolset is to train the trainer. The Government will continue to perform market research to determine if the individuals who have been participants of the training have gone on to work for companies that could ultimately compete for this work in the future. Future requirements will be evaluated for competition and procured in a manner beﬁtting the circumstances. 8. Market Research: Market research was performed from approximately February ~ June 2018 as prescribed by FAR 10.001(a). GRL technical representatives and the contracts ofﬁce identiﬁed Michael Rainey and Associates, LLC (MRA) as the only source capable of providing the level of expertise that is required for this contract and that are eligible for the award of a Department of Defense contract. The contracting ofﬁce posted a synopsis to FBO for the 8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ERDC Control Log # 18-0155 Justiﬁcation Review Document for Other than Full and Open Competition For a New IDIQ Contract for Sage Geospatial Research and Technical Support prescribed thirty (30) day period, which received no responses, Additionally, both GSA and the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) were reviewed for possible sources. A search of DSBS using the NAICS code 541990 and the keyword “Sage” resulted in nine (9) vendors with potential capability. Each of the nine (9) vendors was called and asked speciﬁcally if they had knowledge of and experience with Sage geospatial tools, of which zero (0) concerns were familiar with Sage, As previously discussed, a competitive solicitation, W9132V-16-R-0001, for Sage development, testing, and training services was advertised via FedBizOpps in August 2016. Michael Rainey and Associates, LLC, CAGE Code 7DLA8 — Veteran-Owned—Small Business Concern, was the only source to meet the requirements and be deemed technically acceptable, MRA possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities as the only qualiﬁed source to assist ERDC-GRL in development and testing of Sage tools. Currently, there are no known sources that have emerged in the marketplace with the necessary knowledge and experience to successfully fulﬁll the Goverrunent’s requirement, 9, Interested Sources: To date no other sources have expressed an interest to provide the services necessary to develop, enhance, demonstrate, and train the Sage toolset, Since MRA possesses the unique intellectual capital that is required to meet the needs of this solicitation, no other vendors will be sought, 10. Other Facts: Procurement histozy. Services were solicited for a small business set-aside and awarded to small business concern MRA under Contract No, W9132V-1 6-C-0005 (Value: $724,748.03, POP: 27 Sep 2016 — 28 Feb 2018).

Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Ofﬁce of Procurement, Acquisition, and Logistics Technology Acquisition Center 23 Christopher Way Eatontown, NJ 07724 2. Description of Action: The proposed action is for a firm-ﬁxed price (FFP) delivery order issued under a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Govemment- Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC). 3. Description of the Supplies or Services: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Ofﬁce of Information and Technology, requires installation of a location-based Wi-Fi network to provide an industry-standard wireless network in the newly constructed Tulsa Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) located in Tulsa, OK. This action represents an expansion of the wireless mobility technology currently in place for the Muskogee VA Medical Center (VAMC) Information Technology (IT) Area, which currently consists of solely Cisco Uniﬁed Wireless Network (CUWN) hardware (Access Points (APs), Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and associated incidental cable plant, mounting hardware, software, and licenses). This procurement requires the delivery and installation of the following brand name Cisco hardware and associated software and licenses: One (1) Cisco 5520 Series WLC (AIR—CT5520-K9), and forty-three (43) Cisco 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Lightweight APs (AIR-CAP2802i-B-K9 - Dual«band controller-based 802.11a/g/n). There will also be an option to procure up to four (4) additional Cisco 802.11a/b/g/n Lightweight APs (AlR-CAP2802i-B-K9 - Dual-band controller-based 802.11a/g/n). Additionally, this procurement requires professional services to include: design, engineering, installation, conﬁguration, validation, and testing of the infrastructure. The period of performance will require delivery of all hardware as well as completion of all design, installation, configuration, validation, and testing services within six (6) months of award. The total estimated price of the proposed action is $— 4. Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(0) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16,505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled \"Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.” 5. Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: Based on extensive market research, as described in Section 8, it is determined that limited competition is available for the brand name Cisco WLC and AP. The Wi-Fi network for the Tulsa CBOC is required to leverage and connect to the Muskogee VAMC lT Area’s existing CUWN infrastructure. Therefore, the solution must be fully interoperable and compatible with the existing CUWN infrastructure, Control Number: TAC-19—53110 VA is reliant upon Wi—Fi technology in the delivery of healthcare services to veterans. VA utilizes Wi-Fi communications so that healthcare providers and administration staff can connect remotely to the Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture and access patient records, treatment plans, and other healthcare support data without being tied to a deskbound solution. The VA deploys a wide variety of Wi-Fi-enabled equipment to support patient care services including, but not limited to: Medication Carts, Vital Signs Monitors, EKG/ECG Carts, IV Pumps, Portable X-Ray Machines, Sonography carts, Temperature/Environmental Controls, Logistics/Canteen Scanners, Patient Information Boards, Barcode Printers, Vo»Fi handsets, and desktops computers and laptops. In addition to the centralized management paradigm, the VA leverages the Cisco Mobility Service Engines to perform Real Time Location Services. These are a proprietary component of the CUWN architecture. The use of this technology produces Radio Frequency ﬁngerprinting of devices to locate its position within a site campus with a 30‘ accuracy. Disruption in Wi—Fi communications has a very visible and tangible adverse impact to patient care and administrative operations of the affected area(s). Muskogee VAMC IT Area's existing CUWN is an enterprise class wireless system wherein centralized hierarchical hardware conﬁguration, management, monitoring, and alerting occurs. This top down architecture provides a mechanism and methodology to provide FIPS 140-2 validated communications for the enterprise which is scaleable, flexible, and secure. The CUWN utilizes a suite of proprietary product hardware, features, and licenses. Cisco APs and WLCs are part of this unified hardware and software solution that enables the VA to wirelessly communicate information through the Office of Information Technology’s enterprise network. Only brand name Cisco APs and WLCs are compatible and interoperable with the existing CUWN infrastructure, which is proprietary to Cisco. Due to the proprietary nature of Cisco‘s code, no other manufacturer’s APs or WLCs are compatible and interoperable with the current infrastructure. Further, market research has determined that only the CUWN provides the end-to-end comprehensive FIPS 1402 Validated conﬁguration, management, monitoring, alerting and RTLS solution that the VA needs to perform its mrssron. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted in August 2018, details of which are provided in section 8 of this justification. This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements. However, it was determined that limited competition is viable among resellers for these brand name items. In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will not be synopsized, and this justiﬁcation will not be made publicly available within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page as the estimated value of this proposed acquisition is below the simpliﬁed acquisition threshold; however, this justiﬁcation shall be posted with the solicitation on the NASA SEWP web site for review by prospective GWAC holders, 7. Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed. 8. Market Research: Market research was conducted by VA wireless technology subject matter experts in August 2018 by researching similar products via both direct outreach to other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) Page 2 of 4 Control Number: TAG-1963110 and intemet catalog research and review The subject matter experts found other similar products from the following manufacturers: Aerohive, Ubiquiti, and Hewlett Packard (Aruba). The subject matter experts concluded that both Aerohive and Ubiquiti failed to meet VA's requirements because they are not FIPS 140-2 certiﬁed. nor are they interoperable and compatible with the existing CUWN. The subject matter experts determined that Hewlett Packard (Aruba) does offer FIPS 140-2 certiﬁed solutions; however, those solutions do not meet the VA's requirements because they are not interoperable and compatible with the existing CUWN. As a result of the market research, the Government’s technical experts determined that none of these OEMs can meet the Government's combined interoperability, compatibility, and security requirements, and as a result only the brand name Clsco APs and WLCs are capable of meeting all of VA's requirements 9. Other Facts: None. Page 3 of 4"}

Section C: Justification for Soliciting from a Single Source or Brand Name The BrowZine Journal Engagement Service is vital to the ongoing mission ofAFRL. There is no other service providing end»user focused browsing of peer-reviewed academic literature covering the broad fields of scientific research comparable to the content ofthese publications provided byThird lron.The access provided to the full depth and breadth ofthe library's journal collections is an essential quality to the AFRL library's requirements. This subscription will need to meet the information needs of a wide variety ofAFRL scientists and engineers (S&Es),This resource will provide information and data to the AFRL D'Azzo Research Library, serving four of the AFRL technical directorates. AFRL's requirement is for a subscription journal management and engagement platform that meets the demands of high level technical services. The subscription must offer the services to meet the needs ofa broad user base, provide high quality resources, and be accessible in all locations. The comprehensive nature ofthe BrowZine Journal Engagement Service make it the only feasible supplier that can meet the AFRL library's needs and provide customers with an all~inc|usive scientiﬁc literature collection.There are not comparable resources in the market that would cover all ofthese aspects ofthis ﬁeld in one place with the same functionality and access, Third Iron has exclusive legal copyright to its interfaces and platforms.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. 10 U.S.C. 2304(cX1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) was the OEM of the AV-EB. MDC merged with the Boeing Company (Boeing) in 1997 making Boeing the prime contractor for all AV-SB 1&A Number: 17-0439 production aircraﬂ. The USG possesses only limited rights to data necessary to integrate AIM- 9X and Satellite Communications into the aircraft and only Boeing has the essential system integration expertise and aircraﬁ performance knowledge necessary for maintaining, upgrading, or adding new capabilities. As the sole developer and manufacturer, Boeing is the only ﬁrm to possess the requisite knowledge of the AV-SBs engineering design, soﬁware development for the tactical soﬁware, integration of ﬁmction improvements, and new weapons upgrades. The estimate cost associated with developing another source to meet agency requirements would be substantial and delays associated with developing another source are unacceptable. The current value for the USMC AV-XB aircraft is approximately $30 million dollars which represents the estimated costs that an independent party would need to execute the mission set. Notwiﬂistanding the aireraﬁ cost, is the cost for the technical data pacicagc to include the drawings. data rights, and technical expertise associated with this mission set which cannot be adequately deﬁned in dollar value as this program is near its end of operational life cycle with the Joint Strike Fighter replacing the AV-SB capability in the near future. As stated herein, this estimated duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition consistent with FAR 6.302(a)(2)(ii)(A). 6. Description of Eﬁ‘orts Made to Soilcit Offers from as Many Offerors as Pracﬁcahie In accordance with DFARS PGI 206302-101), 8 Sources Sought announcement we! posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on 06 March 2017. No responses were received. In accordance with FAR 5 2010))(1), the proposed contract was synopsized on the FEDBIZOPS website on 09 March 2017 and no responses or inquiries were received. No additional market research was conducted because it is not practicable, for the reasons discussed in paragraph 5 above, for any company other than The Boning Company to provide the required supplies and services. 7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Ofﬁcer shall ensure that all supplies and services provided under this connect are procured at a fair and reasonable price. The Contractor will submit a formal price proposal with certiﬁed cost or pricing data and sufficient information to support the accuracy and reliability of the estimate. The Boeing Company’s proposal will be reviewed by experienced technical analysts, cost analysts and contract specialists with the aid of necessary ﬁeld pricing support. The Contracting Ofﬁcer will utilize coat and price analysis as the basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price. 8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition. For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NAVAIR has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the types of supplies/services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NAVAlR will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. Because this effort is a follow-on for supplies and services previously awarded on a non- competitive basis, in accordance with DFARS PGI 206.304(a)(i), the prior J&A was provided to the approval authority for review. Approval of this J&A signiﬁes the approval authority has made the determination required by DFARS PGI 206.304(a)(ii)."}

The authority and supporting rationale (See FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) and if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service. The authority supporting the rationale is FAR 8.405-6(a)(l)(i)(C) “In the interest of economy and efﬁciency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must n0t have been previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures.” , USAID’s Center for Professional Development (CPD) focuses its resources and activities to attain and maintain Agency training programs that integrate the objectives of its Global Workforce Learning Strategy (GWLS). The Center has made signiﬁcant strides to improve the quality of its training speciﬁc to the suite of courses designated for equipping supervisors and managers with the skills needed to be successful in their roles. The contract provides for training supervisors at the appropriate level. The Manager Certiﬁcation Course (MCC) is an example of the Agency’s redress for ensuring its Second Line Supervisors are trained; however, this training could not be dwigned until successful iterations and integration of the Supervisor Certiﬁcation Course (SCC). The (MCC) is designed as a continuum to the (SCC) The courseware for the (MCC) was received on July to, 2018 for ﬁnal review. The beta and pilot for this course are scheduled for October 1—3, 2018 and December ll~13, 2018 and currently this contract expires on March 30, 2019 which would not allow enough time to make revisions based on required course observations and evaluations to the design Further, Encompass has demonstrated its ability and dedication to truly custom programs at the request of the client. Encompass is familiar with the Agency’s mission as uresult of managing projects across various bureaus, independent ofﬁces and missions. They have the expertise to design and deliver curriculum for the various USAID hiring categories, to include our Third Party Country National (TCN) staff. On July 16, 2018 Encompass delivered the ﬁnal draft of coursewsre fora new course entitled, HR Basics. This course is designed to train HR specialists, HR assistants and EXOs in the ﬁeld and to alleviate the skills gap for ’I’CN staff as a result of there being no formal training associated with their roles as HR specialists and assistants. This new course is scheduled for 2 l)ctas and pilot session before the contract expires: October 13110, 2018; December 3-7, 2018, and February 4-8, 201‘). Although, these sessions can be facilitated before the terms of the award expires, there will not be enough time to make the required revisions or changes to the eourseware as a result of course observations and assessments. Finally, this vendor has also began work on creating several eLearning modules for Employee Performance & Development (EP&D) courses which will not be completed by March 30, 2019, to include the redesign of the existing C3 Foreign Service 5-week Orientation. It is essential that the Center provide ongoing teclmical and leadership development training to its employees. In the likelihood that the support services had to he handed ol‘l‘to another “implementer” it would cost the Government additional funds for the new implementer to make assessments appropriate for revising the course design Disruption to the continuity of the aforementioned contract would result in substantial delays and create a critical gap in training for all staff in the metropolitan areas and mission locations. The Center for Professional Development (CPD) recognizes the curriculum development expertise of Encompass based on industry awards; end of course surveys and favorable assessments by a third~party vendor working on HR Transformation Encompass consistently receives average overall ratings ot‘4.75 or higher on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest for delivery and quality of service. Throughout the life of the contract Encompass has demonstrated its commitment to the overarching goals of the Agency as they have developed quality curriculum, facilitated quality and engaging instruction, and produced comprehensive analysis critical to broadening the depth of learning experiences needed to develop employees, leaders, supervisors and managers globally. Encompass’s most recent CPARS ratings for the 04/01/2017 — 03/31/2018 rating cycle were as follows: .

A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(11) Market research was conducted December 2018. The information available in several MOBIS contracts which are located under the GSA Schedule indicated that the costs of many of the applicable labor categories far exceeded the rates for this current contractual vehicle by 15% .

In accordance with the exception requested, FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), the order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efﬁciency because it is a logical follow-cit to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original award. The new services described above are a logical continuation (follow-on) to existing services provided by Research Triangle Institute (RTI, and award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays. 5. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable: Market research was conducted December 2018, The information available in several MOBIS ‘ contracts which are located under the GSA Schedule indicated that the costs of many of the applicable labor categories far exceeded the rates for this current contractual vehicle by 15%.

A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may tnke to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the exception to fair opportunity before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made: No barriers to entry are foreseen for future procurements.le Human Capital and Talent Management, Center for Professional Development (HCTM/CPD) team is in the planning phase of the follow-on activity for this upcoming requirement which will be competed utilizing Category Management: GSA Human Capital & Training Solutions (HCaTS) holders. All holders will he considered. 8. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: This contractor provides a unique qualiﬁcation to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the areas of: (WWT) addresses the continuous need for ensuring Contracting/Agreement Ofﬁcer Representatives (COR/AORs) are trained in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), USAID Automated Directives System (ADS), USAID policy updates, AID Acquisition and Assistance Regulations (AIDAR), and other applicable regulations, manuals, and directives. These services are provided by way of: training design, development and implementation of new and existing courseware. To this end, the Center for Professional Development (CPD) is focusing its resources and activities to attain and maintain an Agency training program that integrates the objectives of its Global Workforce Learning Strategy (GWLS). The Center has made signiﬁcant strides to improve the quality of its training speciﬁc to the suite of courses designated for COR/AORs and program managers. It is essential that the Center provide ongoing technical training to ensure CORs/AORs maintain required certifications to serve in their official capacity. An extension to this award would also allow CPD to streamline operational requirements for providing prerequisite and systems applications training on various acquisition application systems. This task Order #AID-OAA-TOJ 5-00035 has demonstrated its ability and dedication to truly customize programs at the request of the client. It is essential that the Center provide ongoing technical and leadership development training to its employees. In the likelihood that this support services had to be handed off to another “ilnplemcnter” it would cost the Government udditional funds for the new implementer to make assessmenls appropriate for revising the course design. Disruption to the continuity ot‘the aforementioned contract would result in substantial delays and create a critical gap in training for all staff in the metropolitan anti mission locations, RTI's most recent CPARS ratings for the 10/2017-07/2018 rating cycle were as follows: Quality - Exceptional; Schedule - Satisfactory; Cost Control - Exceptional; Management - Exceptional. 9.

The proposed contractor is Ardent Management Consultants (MC), 1840 Michael Faraday Drive, Suite 130, Reston VA 20190. 3. Description of Supplies/Services. The scope of this requirement is to obtain support in the areas of program management, coordination, content management, website maintenance, interoperability and standards development, self-assessment resource development, competency and tradecrai‘t development, and technology research and development services associated with the Homeland Security Geospatial Conceit of Operations (GeoCONOPS) program The independent government cost estimate is The period of performance for this task order IS a six month base period with three one-month option periods.

Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized pursuant to FAR 8,405- 5(8)(1)(i)(B)- LSJ Nor: FYl9—0144 1— l A Limited-Sou rces Justiﬁcation (LSJ) For orders or BPAs exceeding the Simpliﬁed Acquisition Threshold The GeoCONOPS program is dedicated to providing other Federal, State, Local, Tribal and Territorial agencies the geospatial clan: that is used to support ongoing national special security events, incidents, and reporting which can include potential loss of lives and threats to national infrastructure. ArdentMC provides continuous GeoCONOPS Content Management Support for Online Resources and Website Support. While other vendors may be able to provide these services, ArdentMC is the only vendor that has a specialized combination of‘geospatial knowledge and administration services, and a vendor offsite development and testing environment required to successfully complete this requirement. It would be unrealistic to realize the necessary level of continuity required to sustain operations without signiﬁcant impact to mission critical IT systems should the vendor be replaced. lfthere is a lapse in service, DHS will not be able to provide new and updated geospatial data online resources utilized by other Federal, State, and Local agencies that provide situational awareness and decision making in their respective operation centers. Not being able to provide current updated data to these customers, can result in the inability to make accurate and timely decisions needed to prevent loss of life and property. Geospatial data has been used to protect and secure the National Special Security Events (NSSE’s) (i.e., UN General Assembly, 2019 State of the Union Address) or provide information viml in response to National Disasters/Emergency events such as the collection, management, and sharing of geospatial data, e.g., road closures, egress routes, casualty collection points (i.e., for Hurricane Michael and most recent recovery efforts Tornado in Alabama). ArdentMC has the institutional knowledge of the systems, ongoing operations, procedures and processes working with our many Federal, State, local, tribal and territorial agency partners. It has subject matter experts on staff with the current knowledge and security clearances to perform these services. As mentioned before, there are other Vendors that can perform the services but under the current circumstances and the short time period there is no reasonable expectation that the other sources have the time or the experience and understanding of the DHS Headquarters Geospatial Management Ofﬁce’s wide customer base with the multiple and diverse requirements to immediately fulﬁll the Government‘s needs. A new vendor would require time to ramp up its knowledge and skillset to provide the continuous services of the Govemment’s requirements and would not be able to start working in the midst of on-going operations. Any prolonged break in service will potentially jeopardize the continuity of services the current contractor provides which would introduce an unnecessary and unacceptable risk to DHS. Furthermore, the DHS HQ Entry on Duty (EOD) process to adjudicate access to DHS systems and facilities can take on average between 30 to 180 days depending on the clearance level. The long lead time involved with bringing on new resources poses signiﬁcant risks to the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of mission—critical IT systems. The impact of not retaining the incumbent would be realized immediately. Due to the short duration of the proposed task order, replacing the incumbent would not be beneﬁcial since there is an ongoing effort to award a logical follow-on to this vehicle. The current BPA order was competed under DHS Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) HSHQDC- l3—A-00046 which expired in September 201 8. The current BPA order expires on March 14, 2019. It will be re-competed under the new multiple-award GTSS 2.0 BPA when it is established in the June/July 2019 timeframe. The existing requirements will be re-competed and awarded in two to three months. The new GTSS 2.0 BPA was scheduled to be established by March 2019; however, LSJ No.:FY1970144 l-2- Limited»Suurms Justiﬁcation (LSJ) For orders or BPAs exceeding the Simpliﬁed Acquisition Threshold due to a Government delay, the EPA establishment date has been pushed back. As a result, it is necessary to continue these services with ArdentMC. 5. Determination by the contracting ofﬁcer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The Contracting Ofﬁcer has determined that awarding the proposed task order to Ardent Management Consultants represents the best value to the Government and the expected costs will be fair and reasonable based on the vendor‘s General Services and Administration (GSA) contract. The msk order will be placed in accordance Wlﬂ’l FAR 8.404, Use of Federal Supply Schedules. The GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable prices for the services on the vendor’s GSA schedule contract. Discounts to the GSA schedule rates will be requested. The level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform the speciﬁc tasks being ordered will be considered in order to determine that the total price is reasonable. The contractor’s labor mix and level of effort will also be compared to the independent government cost estimate. 6. A description of the market research. Market research was conducted among GSA schedule 70 contract holders providing similar services Based on past experience, it was determined that there is no reasonable expectation that other sources would be able to quickly ramp up (e.g. completing the BOD process and understanding GMO customer base requirements) to effectively provide the services in this short period oftime. 7.

These services allow EIS to improve business processes and workﬂows, saving USPTO time and money without sacriﬁcing high quality performance. These critical elements provided by EIS allow USPTO to fulﬁll its mission. Further, awarding this action to the incumbent is the most practical option due to the reduced start up time given the imminent expiration of the culrent contract. Efforts to solicit as many potential sources as possible The Patents Program Management Support (PPMS) recompetition solicitation was posted on 24 January 20l9. As a result, thirteen (13) companies submitted proposals. Procurement time was lost due to the longest government shutdown in US. history, spanning a total of 35-days, and the USPTO does not have a reasonable expectation of making contract award prior to expiration of the current PPMS Contract (DOC44PAPT1309032) on 15 March 2019. Therefore, the USPTO seeks to enter into a ﬁve (5) month sole-source contract with Enterprise Information Services, Inc. (BIS) to pmvidc continuity of mission critical services. This extension will allow enough time to perform a through evaluation, as well as, ensure ample time that any contract awarded to a non-incumbent Contractor has a greater likelihood of success by allowing adequate transition time between the incumbent and incoming Contractor. Determination by the Contracting Ofﬁcer that anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable The anticipated cost of this acquisition will be fair and reasonable as evidenced by the signature of the Contracting Ofﬁcer. Detailed documentation and justiﬁcation of price reasonableness will be disclosed in the Acquisition Form Documentation (AFD) to be prepared upon completion of negotiations. Market Research Market research was conducted and a Request for Information (RFI) was issued on January 17, 2019 and closed on January 22, 2019. The RFl found that there were many vendors capable of providing services associated with the PPMS requirement. A Request for Quotation (RFQ) was posted on January 28, 2019. Vendors were asked to submit questions by January 31, 2019. USPTO responses to questions was posted February 12, 2019 with a submission deadline of February 20, 2019 for all quotes. A total of 13 vendors submitted quotes in response to the RFQ. A technical evaluation of the 13 quotations is currently being in process. Form # USPTO-OPv026. v2.0 (9/17) 2 8.

MEPCOM 16 Service Desk Messages are created, approved, veriﬁed and emailed from the Seivice Desk to users to inform them of various outages and issues related to MEPCOM J 6. Page 3 of 12 Version 1.3 August 11, 2016 MEPCOM J6 Service Desk Messages — Creation & Dissemination Process 1) MEPCOM J6 Service Desk Messages are to be draﬂed by the team who is responsible for the CA Ticket, Change Order or Software Change Proposal that is tied to an outage or issue that warrants internal or ﬁeld notiﬁcation. MEPCOM 16 Service Desk Messages sent to the Service Desk are to be sent in the approved format ready for transmission, to include the distribution list. Prior to the message being sent to the Service Desk the Branch Chief or Division Chief will review the message and approve it. If neither is available a Team Lead or other Branch Chief will provide the review and approval. a) b) Unscheduled outages or issues 7 Messages are to be sent to the Service Desk no later than 30 minutes aﬁer the outage or the start of the issue. The Service Desk is to be called informing that there is an unscheduled issue and the message is waiting to be transmitted.

After the message has been transmitted it is to be copied into a Word docmnent and a copy attached to the CA Ticket or Change Order. A copy is to be uploaded to the DEPS message folder and the ‘Message Traelcing’ spread sheet update with the message information Page 5 of 12 Version 1.3 August 11, 2016 MEPCOM J6 Service Desk Messages — F ormatﬁng Templates for the Service Desk messages are located on the Service Desk DEPS site. The appropriate template is to be copied into a new email and edited. The template itself should not be changed. 0 General 0 Make sure the Battalion Commander for the MEPS is in the ‘TO’ list 0 Make sure ‘MEPS’»All Personnel is in the ‘TO’ list 0 Make sure the ‘For Approval’ is removed from the subject line before sending Make sure the font is ‘Times New Roman’ 0 Make sure the pitch is ‘13’ Make sure there are two(2) spaces aﬁer each ‘2’ 0 Make sure there are two(2) spaces after each ‘.’ 0 Make sure the section heading is ‘Bald’ 0 Make sure the message is sent as ‘Rieh Text’ If this is a follow up to a message the changes are to be in ‘Red’ 0 Verify the Ticket or Change Order number Obtain the next Message Number from the Message Tracking File located on DEPS or ask the Service Desk to forward a template for the referenced outage type MEPCOM J6 Service Desk Message Completion/Resolution 1. Completion messages do not require any explanation as to what work was done. Completion messages only require the ‘COMPLETED’ stamp on the message subject and Service Desk Message ID line. Completion message can only be sent for CA Change Orders. Resolved messages require an explanation as to the work that was performed to resolve the outage or issue. This explanation is to be written in a way that the end user will understand. The explanation Page 6 of 12 Version 1.3 August 11, 2016 should not contain high level technical information. Resolved messages are sent for CA Tickets. Cancelled messages require an explanation as to why the work or issue is being cancelled. If the item is being rescheduled, the reschedule date/time needs to be included. Cancelled messages can be sent for either a CA Change Order or Ticket. Reminder messages do not require any explanation as to the work being done. They only contain the ‘REMINDER’ stamp on the message Subject and Service Desk Message Identiﬁcation line. Reminder messages can be sent for either a CA Change Order or Ticket. MEPCOM J6 Service Desk Message — Updates The Branch that is assigned the CA Ticket or Change Order is responsible to provide an update on the Service Desk Message every day at 0900 and 1500 hrs for issues/outages that affect Applicant processing. Any message concerning an issue/outage that does not affect Applicant processing will be updated once a day at 1500. These updates are to be added to the top of the message and be in a format that will allow for them to be transmitted to the ﬁeld. The Branch will also update the ticket or Change Order with the infonnation. If no new information is available for the ticket or change order, then the Branch Chief will eMail the ECSB Branch Chief and provide an estimated date as to when to expect an update.

Affected End Users Name 2.) Request Area 3.) Priority 4.) Group 5.) Summary 6.) Description Affected End Users Name This is usually the person on the phone or the Information Technology Specialist of the associated MEPS. Some users like Test Administrators do not have an account in CA. If this is the case, you will need to enter the ITSs name in the Affected End Users box and make sure that the user’s name is entered into the Summary or Description. The name of the user that is having the issue (ex. Doe, John) Page 8 of 12 Version 1.3 August 11, 2016 W This area is to let the tech know closely what the issue entails For example, MIT.CLI_APP.EXEL would be entered into this box letting the Tech know that this issue refels to an Excel issue. In the event that you cannot locate a request area that matches the issue enter \".MI'1' Slams When creating a ticket “Open” should always be set. Page 9 of 12 Version 1.2 July 10, 2015 Pn'orig Priority MUST always be set. The usual Priority number for this command is a 3. This is medium priority. Your choices for priority are 1 through 5. 1. Priority 1 is to be used by HQ MEPCOM personnel only. Priority 1 is for major items that affect the entire system or have serious mission impact at multiple MEPS. 2. Priority 2 is to be used when a MEPS is completely down or when a MEPS is having issues that severely impacts processing. Priority 3 is used for mission impact issues where a workaround exists. Priority 4 is used for non-mission impact issues. Priority 5 is currently not is in use. This priority level may be used once the new version of CA is deployed. .V'FP’ Guam This area is speciﬁcally set to assign the ticket to a certain group. For example, a ticket with MIT.CSD.SW would be assigning the ticket to the Desktop Support Team. See break down below. . . There are many choices that we will attempt to break them down. (ex. MTT.CSD.HW) MIT.CSD.HW — CSD is the group name for Desktop Support (Workstation issues). HW is only for Hardware issues. MIT.CSD.SW — Same as above but, SW is for only Software issues. MIT.CSD.ESB.WST — WST is the group name for the Windows Server Team. MIT.CSD.ESB.NIX —NIX is the group name for the AIX Server Team. M]T.Helpdesk — This group is the starting point of all Service Desk tickets. MITle — All Information Assurance issues need to be assigned here. (Network Security questions/issues, Viruses. etc.) MIT.NSD — Issues that deal with actual networking issues. This includes Routers, Switches, Etc. MIT.PlansandPolicyDivision — This group is for issues surrounding contracts, life— cycle, soﬂware licensing, replacement of equipment that no longer under warrant. Page 10 of 12 Version 1.2 July 10, 2015 Summa This section should be short and yet be a very descriptive summary of the comments in the description section. Description This section should be as detailed as possible. Please make sure that you ask the following questions as this will help ensure that tickets get assigned to the correct Group in CA and does not get kicked around What is their name? What is the computer name? Depending on the issue you may need the IP Address. Are you at the computer now? If so, is it a different extension than what is in the address book? Is the user at another location? If so, can we have that number? Who all is affected by this issue? Are they the only one? Is the issue hardware or software? If soﬁware, what soﬁware was being used when the error occurs? Ifit’s a hardware issue, what is the hardware component causing the issue (ie. Monitor, Printer, etc.)? Does this happen all the time? Were you able to connect before? What is the Make, Model Number and Serial #? prossible, remote into the user’s computer and capture a Screen Shot that will be placed in the ticket to help the tech that is assigned the ticket. Page 11 of12 Version 1.2 July 10, 2015 CA Unicenter Tickets 1. The Service Desk Technicians will review the active tickets and assign those tickets to the appropriate branch. The branch assigned will be responsible for assigning the ticket to the teclmician for action. 2. When a P1 or P2 is going to be assigned to another branch, the Service Desk will attempt to contact the branch via phone or in person to provide a “hand off”. 3. The Branch assigned will provide a properly formatted draﬁ message to the Service Desk for approval and transmission. 4. HQ/Jé assigned technicians will update P1 and P2 tickets at the least twice daily (morning and afternoon). P3, P4 and P5 tickets will require an update at least once a week. 5. Resolve/Closing Tickets 7 The technician assigned to the ticket is responsible for notifying the affected end user when a ticket is considered resolved and is responsible to follow—up with the end user to conﬁrm resolution of their issue and agree to CLOSE the ticket. This should be logged into the ticket as a comment. 6. Service Desk Battalion Assignments 7 Service Desk Technicians will monitor all open MIT Tickets for their assigned Battalion and check that MIT tickets are being updated on a regular basis (minimum once per week) and ensure that no tickets are aging with no progress or falling through the cracks. When a user or ITS contacts the Service Desk to open a new issue, they will still call the general number -, and any Service Desk Technicians will create the ticket. The Battalion assignments are intended for a \"monitoring and reviewing\". Page 12 of 12"}

We are authorized to limit competitlon on the hasls ofthc citation in section 4 because: The Evert: product line was chosen for use at NAVCC for its wide variety of functions, the ability to monitor and control the individual constituent cards from a central location, the breadth offunctions available compared to other vendors at price points competitive with other vendors, and for functions not available in a commonly-managed platform from other vendors, This acquisition is to purchase spare equipment or upgraded functionality for the existing Evertz system, Only Evert: equipment matching the model numbers (or having a functionally equivalent replacement model) for which they are to serve as spares is a functional substitute for the equipment for which these can act as spares Evert: equipment docs not support other vendors manufacturing cards for their card cages (they simply don’t physically ﬁt) and support soﬁware, so do not have the option of 3\" party vendor cards for use with this system 6. Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition Before Subsequent Contract Is Required State what actions, if any, the program ofﬁce can take to overcome bat-nets to competition before a contracting for this requirement again. such as: using action to provide time to develop speciﬁcations for a competitive pmmmncnl by a certain date; licensing copyrights or parents so other contracts»: may use the works; or breaking the requirement into parts that may be purchased competitively. lfthis is a onevlimc Icquircmcnt, explain that action to inwwse future competition is not needed If the scum: is expressly required by statute, slate \"Source is statutory.” To Increase competition, we will: 3\"1 party vendor cards, equipment or software is not manufactured for the Evertz product line. Evertz does not support non-Everlz cards for its card cages or its mangemcnt software packages Should such 3\"1 party vendor equipment or soﬁwarc become authorized we would need to test and validate it in our plant with the current Evertz equipment to confirm functional equivalence. Should such hardware or software become factory authorized and pass our NAVCC—speciftc functional requirements in the futurc we will consider such 3\" party items for inclusion in the existing NAVCC Evert; systems. 7.

Statement of Work PlD: N66421 - 19 7 simacq -447666A— 947 A. Background The AIR 4.4 NlFT/FroNTO has established a noise modeling capability under a previous NISE-WFD project. This makes use of multiple Computational Fluid Dynamics software packages. In order to develop noise models, a commercial “meshelj’ must develop input files that define the geometry. Pointwise was chosen for this task due to- its compatibility with the tools being used, its widespread through the OEMs and small businesses who collaborate in various ways for this tasking, and because it was already in use in-4.4.7.2. ' B. Technical Requirements Pointwise is able to graphically define and mesh 2—D and 3-D geometries and output the results in industly standard formats. This is a sole source purchase. 0.

Allowability nd Value added Tax (VAT) on De Minimus Purchases.pdf: a; USAID TANZANIA FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MEMORANDUM DATE: February 25, 2019 FROM: Ayana Angulo, Contracting Offlcer T0: File SUBJECT: Allowability of Value Added Tax (VAT) on De Minimus Purchases Summary This memorandum authorizes payment of VAT on procurements under $500 as allowable costs for USAID/Tanzania contractors, grantees, and recipients. Backgrou nd In Tanzania, USAID-funded contractors, grantees, and recipients (“Implementing Partners\") are exempt under the 1968 Framework Bilateral agreement and multi-year Strategic Objective and Strategic Assistance Agreements from the VAT. Therefore, VAT payments on transactions of any amount typically would not be an allowable cost.‘ However, VAT exemption and refund processing procedures are complex and require signiﬁcant time commitments from both implementing partners and USAID’s Executive Ofﬁce. Since 2005, USAID/Tanzania has had in place a blanket determination based on a cosUbeneflt analysis that VAT payments on transactions less than $500 are allowable. This memorandum updates the Mission’s September 16, 2005 determination regarding the allowability of VAT on purchases less than $500 because a number of the provisions cited in that determination have been (non»substantively) revised. Discussion Under section 7013(c) of the 2017 Appropriations Act and similar provisions in earlier Appropriations Acts (beginning with section 579 of the 2003 Appropriations Act), Congress exempted de minimus purchases from taxation reporting requirements. Subsequent Department of State implementing guidance has set the de minimus threshold at $500. Because the tax payments on transactions below $500 are not reportable for purposes of section 7013(c), there is no signiﬁcant policy beneﬁt to the USO to counterbalance the high administrative burden and cost to obtain tax relief on these de minimus transactions. 1 Only foreign taxes that an entity is legally required to pay are allowable. See §200.470(c) - Taxes (including Value Added Tax). Because Implementing Partners are exempt from the VAT, they are not legally requn‘ed to pay it, and therefore VAT payments are not generally allowable. Authority Recently-issued Procurement Executive Bulletin (PEB) No. 2017-02 (Exemptions and Allowability of Host-Country Taxes, November 16, 2017) recognizes the CO/AO’s authority to determine that taxes are allowable costs where the administrative burden incident to obtaining the exemption outweighs the corresponding beneﬁts accruing to USAlDi For contracts, the PEB recognizes this authority in FAR 31‘205-41(b)(3) and for assistance instruments the PEB recognizes this authority in 2 CFR 200.470(b)(1)(i). This includes authority to approve a de minimus allowability oftaxes. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, payments of the VAT on procurements under $500 are allowable costs for USAID/Tanzania contractors, grantees, and recipients, including under GZG and similar instruments, because the administrative burden of obtaining an exemption or refund for transactions under $500 outweighs the corresponding beneﬁt accruing to the USG, Attachments: Procurement Executive Bulletin (PEB) No, 2017-02 (Exemptions and Allowability of Host-Country Taxes, November 16, 2017) CLEARANCE SHEET: Allowability of Value Added Tax (VAT) on De Minimus Purchases DRAFTED BY: Greg Butler, RLO, 'butlcr@usaid.gov, ext, 4435 CLEARANCES: Ayana Angulo, Director 0AA Wm Date: 2 Z] 2 [Cf Tim Pruett, EXO M 14’ Date: 0 1/26 /2017 Kn’s Smathers, Controller Date: {/go 9 9 John Greg Butler, RLO Dave: 1/ 7 7/Li I V\tAttachment_J.2._Notice_1-_International_Travel_related_to_Visa_Renewal.pdf: USAID | TANZANIA FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Ofﬁce of Acquisition and Assistance (0AA) 0AA- IP Notice — 2018-01 March 29, 2018 To: All USAID/Tanzania Implementing Partners (IPs) From: Ayana Angulo, Director, OAA/Tanzania Wag (( k Subject: Appropriate Locations and Prices USAID/1‘ anzania will Consider for International Travel related to Visa Renewal USAID/1‘ anzania understands that oﬁentimes personnel in support of USAID’s activities have to travel to renew their visas every three months while awaiting their work permits.

BACKGROUND: 1. FAR 13.106»! b)(1)(i) states for purchases not exceeding the simpliﬁed acquisition threshold, Contracting O reers may solicit from one source if the Contracting Ofﬁcer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g,, urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand—name or industrial mobilization). 2. As required by FAR 13.106-3(b)(i), this memorandum explains the absence of competition for this acquisition, as only one source will be solicited for this requirement (or for a portion of the requirement) and the requirement (or portion of the requirement to be sole-sourced) is not expected to exceed the simpliﬁed acquisition threshold II. DESCRIPTION OF ITEM OR SERVICE: The purpose of this acquisition is to provide support to the Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) course. Contracted support is necessary to launch, control, and track the Combat SkySat payloads for the period of 10 March 2019 through 29 April 2019. Combat SkySat operations will require all equipment necessary 0.) launch payloads from austere locations located within 100 miles onurna, AZ. Operational support must include two portable ground control stations with the ability to set transmit and receive pairs for Combat SkySat payloads while simultaneously tracking and controlling payloads. The contractors shall provide IO refurbished Combat SkySat payloads, 8 spare 2000g balloons with integrated neck, and Il GPS Tracker subscription to be delivered for the WTI course. III. THE DETERMINATION FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING (select all that apply): A. X ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE (select all that apply): 1, X RESTRICTIVE RIGHTS. The source has established proprietary rights, limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights or secret processes in the item or service required. Space Data Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the Combat SkySat payloads and the proprietary ground system necessary to operate them. SkySat was developed in 2005 as an Air Force Space Battle Lab, Schriever AFB, Colorado project using payloads and near-space operations technology developed by Space Data Corporation. Award to any other source would result in substantial cost duplication, time delay and interoperability risks to the Government. Space Data Corporation‘s replacement system and parts are fully compatible with the items to be purchased. Also, the unit at present already possesses an inventory of Space Data Corporation replacement systems and parts (e.g. GPS trackers and spare Combat SkySat payloads) which are fully compatible and wholly familiar to Space Data Corps service providers. Combat SkySat, because it operates at altitudes ranging from 70,000 to 100,000 feet, is the only system that retransmits UHF frequency over distances greater than 400 nautical miles C C The \\Vl‘l course supports operations disbursed across the southwest United States. , Combat SkySnt is the only asset that provides the ability to communicate with USMC , , W W , aviation assets at the distances required to support WTL Combat SkySat has proven to be interoperable with current USMC aviation assets and the ARC-210 radio. Combat SkySat is a near space SATCOM surrogate that allows aviation platforms to communicate over 400 nautical miles, while negating the effects of terrain, using existing USMC program of record radios (both ground and air). Space Data Corp developed, produced, and delivered the Combat SkySat system, its High Altitude Platform Systems solution, at signiﬁcant cost to the Government and over a signiﬁcant period of time. As a result, an award to any other source would undoubtedly result in substantial cost duplication, time delay, and interoperability risks to the Government. If another platform was acquired and utilized, the Government would have to staff and maintain two, non-interfacing systems separately, doing so only at a tremendous cost with no efficiencies or synergies realized Also, the unit at present already possesses an inventory of Space Data Corp replacement systems and pans (e.g., Balloons, GPS trackers) which are, of course, fully compatible with the items to be purchased and wholly familiar to Space Data Corps service providers 2. _ EXCLUSIVE LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

AFFARS 5313.106-1(b) AFIT currently has a lease subscription with OARnet for the use of OARnet managed VMware Helizon View software licenses. The subscription is used to replace desktop and server computer systems with virtual servers and desktops reducing the need for hardware refresh. VMware is an Air Force approved virtualization solution. OARnet is the only maintenance source for AFIT's continued use of the VMware licenses that are on lease. Due to the fact that AFIT does not own these VMware licenses, but leases the right to use OARnet's VMware licenses. no other vendor can provide support/maintenance for the OARnet managed licenses. In order to change to a different vendor. AFIT would have to purchase the licenses as well as maintenance.

Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) -The world's leading provider of business information and related services, has over 165 years transformed disarrayed sources of company data into actionable intelligence needed to make conﬁdent business decisions. It is this ability to turn an enormous stream of raw data into high quality business information that differentiates them from other competitors. D&B‘s patent-pending process for collecting and enhancing data is called DUNSRighFM. Founded on Quality Assurance, which includes over 2,000 separate automated and manual checks to maximize the integrity of our data, DUNSRIght\"M also includes ﬁve quality drivers that work sequentially to aggregate, standardize and enrich the data: Global Data Collection, Entity Matching, the D—U-N-S® Number, Corporate Linkage and Predictive Indicators. D&B invests over $250 million annually in DUNSRightTM and incorporates over 1.5 million daily updates to their database as a result of this investment. Their unique value includes: Global Data Collection. Global Data Collection aggregates data from hundreds of sources to provide superior breadth and depth ofbusiness information — enabling them to create a global business database of unparalleled quality, currency and comprehensiveness. D&B maintains over 129 million company records from more than 190 countries, ranging from large publicly traded companies to small privately held businesses and sole proprietorships. Over our 160-year history, we have perfected the art of collecting and synthesizing disparate sources of company information. 20f5 Entity Matching. Entity Matching is D&B’s proprietary method for integrating the data we collect into our global business database. This process allows for and corrects variations in spelling (e.g. IBM vs. lntemational Business Machines), formats, tradestyles and addresses, among other elements, and associates data from disparate sources (e.g. a state business license, a federal 10K ﬁling, a Yellow Pages listing) with the appropriate D&B record Aiding in this effort is a sophisticated system of Match Grades and Conﬁdence Codes that maximize the likelihood that a search of or match against our global business database returns the correct company match. The D-U-N-S Number. The D- -N-S Number is a unique, nine-digit identiﬁcation code that is assigned and maintained solely by D&B. The global standard for company identiﬁcation, the D-U-N-S Number is assigned to a company on a location-speciﬁc basis and remains with that speciﬁc business unit even if it closes or goes out-of-business. All D&B business data (up to 1,500 data elements) is linked to D-U-N-S Numbers including the business name, address, tradestyles (dba‘s), principal names, ﬁnancial and payment information, industry codes (SlC/NAICS), socio-economic status, corporate linkage, predictive scores, status as a government contractor/grantee and more. In sununary, D&B is the only source for the aforementioned capabilities and can supply our agency customers with the most accurate, current and complete company information at a ﬁ'action of what it would cost to duplicate this capability. . A demonstration by the ordering activig— Contracting Ofﬁcer- that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404“). Based on the data gathered, the Contracting Ofﬁcer has determined that the anticipated price to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The expectation ofteaching a fair and reasonable price was determined through market research and historical data in order to determine best value for GSA. . A descrigtion of the market research conducted among schedule holders, and the results of the research, or a statement why market research was not conducted. Market research was conducted by reviewing the Federal Supply Schedule 520. Research involved reviewing Equifax, Nexis Lexis, Experian websites. There are several vendors under this schedule that can meet some of the government needs in providing ﬁnancial reviews of the industry. Only Dun & Bradstreet demonstrated that they have the ability to provide a comprehensive data reports. The recent GSA IT market research revealed the speciﬁc products required are available under GSA schedule contract through only one source. While several of the companies who maintain Financial and Business Solutions schedule contracts under Special Item Number 520-]6 (Business Information Services) offer some form of business credit report, D&B is the sole provider whose reports leverage the federal govemrnent's company identiﬁcation standard (the D-U-N-S Number) and D&B's extensive global data collection infrastructure. 30f5 7. It is the presence of the D-U-N-S Number, along with D&B's patented Entity Matching soﬁware, that enables D&B to aggregate thousands of disparate data sources and transform it into the actionable intelligence that allows GSA personnel to decide with conﬁdence. These data sources account for the up to l,500 data elements maintained on each company - information that ranges from socio-economic status, SlC/NAICS codes, payment habits, public ﬁlings, status as a debarred/suspended/ineligible contractor, ﬁnancial statements, risk scores and Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Numbers, among others. A signiﬁcant portion of this information is contained within the most frequently used DSLB reports (e,g. Federal Information Report1 Comprehensive Report, Business Information Report), including corporate linkage, which enables GSA to identify relationships among companies on a global basis. D&B maintains the world's most comprehensive database of global linkage information. Any other facts supporting the limited sources iustiﬁcation.

This document sets forth the facts and rationale justifying the use of limited sources. in accordance with FAR H.405-6{C}. This document was prepared by Moyra McNamara, Bureau for Global Health, Office ofPoIicy, Programs and Planning, regarding GSA Contract No. GSeZSFeSOSOH, USAID Order No. AIDVOAA7M713700004, awarded to Jefferson Consulting Group, LLC, for procurement support. 2. The nature and/or description of the action being approved: This is a request to approve a modification to the existing order to raise the total estimated cost (TEC) by $3,925,600.00 from $47,862,730.00 to $51,788,330.00, and to extend the period of performance of the award by eight months. The increase will not change the scope of the award. Rather the increase will allow Jefferson Consulting to continue providing the same procurement support services to USAID's Bureau for Global Health; namely to provide support to USAID's Bureau for Global Health (GH), USAID's Office ofAcquisition and Assistance (0AA) and USAID missions to more quickly complete a full range of activities associated with the Global Health related procurements and awards. The period of performance of the award from July 29, 2013 —April 28, 2019, will also be extended by eight months, so that the new period of performance end date will be December 28, 2019, The main purpose of the $3,925,600.00 TEC increase and eight—month period of performance extension will be to allow fora followeon competition to run in parallel, which includes time lost during the 35-day government shutdown and time required for security clearances to be established for staffon a new award (three months). 3. Description of the supplies or services required, including an estimated value: GH awarded Jefferson Solutions (Jefferson) the Procurement Support Award (PSA), 3 five»year support contract on July 29, 2013. XL Associates (XLA) and Clare KC are subcontractors to Jefferson. Through PSA, GH, 0AA and the USAID Missions continue to quickly access dedicated resources to support non— inherently governmental acquisition and assistance (A&A) actions for GH-funded and health—related projects. PSA works as a bridge between GH and USAID Mission program offices and 0AA by providing Page 1 of G support throughout the entire acquisition and assistance cycle, as well as supporting specific tasks within the process PSA supports the full acquisition and assistance lifecycle forGH-funded and health-related projects The Washington Office and USAID Missions can request PSA staff for short-term or long»term sen/ices. PSA provides support for the following activities: ~ Planning Phase: Facilitate development ofthe A&A strategy, develop the timeline, conduct market research, develop requisition documents such as A&A elements ofthe Concept Paper and Project Appraisal Document (PAD), develop the Acquisition and Assistance Review and Approval Document (AARAD), and draft the program description/Statement ofWork, proposal instructions, evaluation criteria and accompanying requisition documents such as the Choice of Instrument Memo and IGCE. - Solicitation Phase: Support OAA in developing the full Request for Proposal or Notice of Funding Opportunity (NFO), review documentation prior to submission to the Contract Review Board (CRB), post the solicitation documents to FBOtgov or grantsgov, facilitate the question and answer process, and develop and post amendments. . Evaluation Phase: Support the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) or Selection Committee (SC) in developing the Evaluation or Review Plan, receive proposals/applications, conduct a compliance review, conduct the cost/price analysis, support the TEC/SC in developing required documentation, develop competitive range documentation and the negotiation memorandum, conduct past performance and reference reviews, and review documentation before submission to the CRB. - Award Phase: Notify successful and unsuccessful of‘ferors/applicants, prepare award documentation in GLAAS, prepare post-award debrief materials, and schedule debrief sessions. - Post Award: Track required deliverables, maintain documentation, prepare modification documentation, and track implementing partner performance. . Personal Service Contractor (PSC) Recruitment: Develop the position description, build candidate databases with our personnel management systems, recruit and screen candidates, develop the PSC solicitation, manage the receipt of applications, check references, schedule and conduct interviews, and develop award documentation. Increasing the total value of the award will enable the Contractorto continue to implement ongoing support services as described above. The following are some of the known and estimated needs covered by this request: 0 Overthe past four months, the average PSA expenditure rate for Missions has been $230,700 and the expenditure rate for Washington has been $260,000/month (total of $490,700/month)t This eight month period of performance extension requires an additional $3,925,600.00 be added to the ceiling in order for work to continues 0 The complexity of the award and other factors resulted in the longer time to award than the normal procurement action lead time for this type ofaction. In order to increase competition in the follow~on procurement, 0AA posted the solicitation several times and extended the Page 2 of 6 solicitation. in addition, the quote evaluation took longer than the normal allotted time due to the number ofquotes received. Extenuating circumstances limited the availability ofstaf‘f to participate in the evaluation of the quotes. Limited staff resources on the team led to delays around reviewing the quotes received. - A new challenge since the last extension request was approved includes a 357day government shutdown, which significantly delayed the ability to continue to work on the follow-on award. During this time, no work on the new award could be done, which is a factor in why an extension is needed now. - In addition to the abovementioned reasons for needing an extension. it is essential to ensure there is a smooth transition and sufficient overlap between the old and the new award, thus ensuring no break in service. The prime contractor and staff for PSA and PSA 2 require security clearances, which can take up to three months to be processed, a fact which has been demonstrated during the past two extensions that were processed. The security clearance process, ifnot afforded sufficient time, can negatively impact successful contractor performance. It is necessary to plan for three months of overlap for a proper transition of this contract. 4. Statutory authority permitting limitation of sources and rationale for using the authority, and a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required services: Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6, orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. However. an ordering activity must justify its actions when restricting consideration. In accordance with FAR 8.405—6(a)(1l(i)(c) the justification to limit sources is in the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original task order was awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures and was not previously issued undersoleesource or limitedesources procedures. The acquisition was conducted under the authority of the Multiple—Award Schedule Program in accordance with FAR 8.405-2. The contractor, Jefferson Solutions is a womenrowned small business specializing in providing a full range of acquisition, human capital and program management services to the federal government. The PSA was a competitive task order action from the GSA MOBIS schedule. For five yea rs, Jefferson Solutions has worked on a range of USAID procurement actions in Washington and the Field. Jefferson has ongoing work which would cease if the proposed ceiling increase is not approved. This would significantly put other USAID awards in peril of not being awarded. Jefferson Solutions is uniquely qualified to continue providing the required services while USAID reecompetes this award due to their intimate knowledge ofthe current procurements at USAlD Missions and in Washington. 5. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value to the government consistent with FAR 8.404(d): Page 3 of 6 The requested modiﬁcation does not change the scope of the award and therefore represents a logical continuation ofcurrent efforts. In addition, GSA has already determined the rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts, to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination affair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by FAR 8.405- 2(d). By placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in FAR 8.405, the ordering activity has concluded that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative to meet the Government’s needs. The Contracting Officer has determined the funding increase with Jefferson Consulting, described in this justification, represents the best value consistent with FAR 8,404(d) as evidenced by her signature below. 6. Description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. Market research was not conducted for this modification. This would be a logical followeon to a competed award. A new competitive follow-on award will be made as soon as possible. The requested modification will allow for work to continue while a new competition is in progress. 7. Any other facts supporting the justlfication: To date the contractor has performed exceptionally well, meeting the demands USAID has placed on the project, as noted by the Contracting Officer’s Representative from a qualitative review of their work overthe last year. They have been able and willing to adjust staffing patterns to meet needs. The project has substantially contributed to the award of numerous competitive actions (both acquisition and assistance), several PSC awards and over 500 administrative actions for the Washington based teams and over three times that effort for field-based programs. PSA has supported 25 missions over the life ofthe contract and 13 missions in the last six months alone. The most recent CPARS report also noted \"exceptional” ratings in four categories and “very good\" in one category, with the contractor being recommended for similar requirements in the future. 8. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made. The current award was the first of its kind procured by GH. Although estimates were made, the information regarding the demand for such sen/ices was not robust and therefore the original ceiling was set at a level that underestimated the need. As GH moves forward with a new follow»on procurement, more accurate estimations of the expected demand will allow for better alignment between the period of performance and the expected prices which will remove the need forfuture actions to restrict competition. 9. Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government’s minimum needs or requirements or other rationale for limited Page 4 of 6 sources) and which form a basis for the justification have been certiﬁed as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements persmmelr Yhe lnfnrmatinn conlained in thejustificntion is based on lhe COR‘s interactions with both USAlD/Washington and field missions that have sought services from PSA.

Contracting Activity. National Institute of Standard and Technology (N IST) Ofﬁce of Acquisition and Agreements Management Acquisition Management Division 100 Bureau Drive MS 1640 Gaithersburg MD, 20899 II. Nature and/or Description of the action being approved. This action to be approved is the use of speciﬁc brand name only requirements pursuant to FAR 16.505(a)(4)(i) when restricting consideration to items particular to one manufacturer. This is a brand name only requirement to purchase ZeroFOX Digital Risk Protection for Social Media soﬁware-asa-service licenses. III.A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value). The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program (MEP) at NIST has a requirement to purchase ZeroFOX digital risk protection for social media soﬂware-as-a—service licenses. MEP has used ZeroFOX for the Government’s digital risk protection of social channels for two (2) years and has an existing Low Risk Internet Services Authority to Operate MEP uses a number of social media platforms to communicate about the MEP National NetworkTM such as Twitter, Facebook, Linkedln, and public websites. The MEP Centers also have their own social media channels, which are currently unprotected/unmonitored To protect the National NetworkTM brand, the MEP centers (non-Government entities) also need to protect their individual accounts and cites. Mtt‘ plans to expand this service lo the purchased on a credit card (GSA Schedule) and used on the Govermnent social media channels mentioned above and found to be beneﬁcial and has characteristics that other products do not have. This acquisition will include option years to renew licensing annually. Centers. )Zeroiii (\\xasor'iginail} The estimated value, optional quantities included, is $1,000,000.00. Technology, and Canﬁeld Cyberdefense Group. We found that none of the vendors were capable of meeting MEP’s minimum requirements. This requirement will be competed among small business. ZeroFOX is a small business (maker of the soﬁware) and has resellers who are also small businesses. VII. A statement of the action, if any, the agency make take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. NIST will ensure that continuous market research is conducted before any subsequent contracting actions are undertaken. If appropriate alternatives are identiﬁed that would create a competitive environment, NIST will undertake appropriate action to maximize competition. Price analysis will be done prior to award. The Government expects competition for this requirement. VIII. The ordering activity contracting officer’s certiﬁcation that the justiﬁcation is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer’s knowledge and belief. The Contracting Ofﬁcer signiﬁes, by signing thisjustiﬁcation, that this justiﬁcation is accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief. IX. Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel and which form a basis for the justiﬁcation have been certiﬁed as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel. The Contracting Ofﬁcer’s Representative has signed the Milestone Acquisition Plan, indicating concurrence with the data used to form the basis of this justiﬁcation. X. A written determination by the approving ofﬁcial that one of the circumstances in FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(A through E) applies to this order. By signing this justiﬁcation the Contracting Ofﬁcer and the NIST Competition Advocate both agree that the circumstance in FAR 16.505(b)2(i)(E)—“F0r orders exceeding the simpliﬁed acquisition threshold, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from a speciﬁed source,” applies to this order.

{"id":"95fbb6b9-10d7-4f9d-856c-cdaa9f5120c9","extracted_text":"ID03180011_-_EHRM_Limited_Sources_Justification_(Fed_Biz_Ops).pdf: GSA US. General Services Administration LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION For Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) Initiatives Modification 01 — Release Increase Note: This document is prepared in accordance with the requirements of FAR BAGS-6(a). The acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program. 1. Identiﬁcation of Requiring Activity and Contracting Activity: The requiring acu‘vity is the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) located at Seaside. California. and the Mark Center, Alexandria, Virginia. The contracting activity is the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Mid-Atlantic Region - Philadelphia. PA. This document is hereby identiﬁed as a Limited-Sources Justiﬁcation. 2. Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved: The action being approved is a modiﬁcation to Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) Initiatives order number 47QFMA18F0053 under the Enterprise Services LLC GSA DMDC ITPS Multiple Award BPA contract GSDSQ17DSA0008. The action is necessary to comply with the recently mandated Veterans' Electronic Health Record (EHR) Modernization Oversight Act of 2017 (HR. 4245) to support the implementation of an electronic health or medical record system to replace any or all of the Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture, the Computerized Patient Record System, the Joint Legacy \\ﬁewer, or the Enterprise Health Management Platform. In September 2013, U.S. Secretaries of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) signed a joint statement pledging to achieve interoperability between the two agencies by implementing a single, seamlessly Integrated electronic health record (EHR). This action Is to implement the VA's transition to adopting the same EHR system as the Department of Defense (DoD). EHRM was competitively awarded on 09/24/2018 with a base period of 26 September 2018 through 25 September 2019 with two (2) one-year option periods. This action is required from 01 April 2019 through 25 September 2019, as well as during each of the two (2) one- year option periods. 3. Description of Supplies/Services Required To Meet the Agency's Needs: The Program Executive Ofﬁce, Defense Healthcare Management Systems (FEO DHMS) was chartered by the Secretary of Defense on May 21, 2013 to improve the healthcare of the active duty military, Veterans, and their beneﬁciaries by modernizing the Military Health System (MHS) electronic health record (EHR) and establishing seamless medical data sharing between the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the private sector. This approach will support service members as they transition from military service. drive better clinical outcomes by giving health care providers a full picture of patient medical history, and enhance collaboration with community care partners. Page 1 of 4 EHRM ID03180011 02/14/2019 In September 2018, the Government announced that the VA had decided to migrate their hospitals to the same electronic health record platform that the DoD was migrating to as part of the work being performed under the EHRM Call. This resulted in mandates for DoD and VA to share the same physical central platforms for their patient data and that patient identity management for both DoD and VA would be under the EHRM identity management system. This combined DoDNA system is called the Joint Electronic Health Record (JEHR) management system. DMDC determined that some of the EHRM processes and data need to be enhanced, as well as new processes developed, to support the seamless interoperability between the VA's Master Veteran Index (MVI) and the current EHR platform. This requirement has introduced new use cases and functionality to existing EHRM services based on the VA requirements for JEHR. This new work essentially brings the VA data and functionality up to speed with the current DoD EHR system; once this is accomplished and the VA requirements are fully integrated into the current EHR system, the overall enhancements to modernize the current EHR to the JEHR can resume. 4. Identiﬁcation of Statutory Authority and Justiﬁcation/Rationale for Limiting Sources Demonstrating the Contractor's Unique Qualiﬁcations to Provide the Required Supply/Service: The authority for this action is FAR 8.405—6ta)(1)(i)(B) — Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized While this Call was being awarded, the VA was still analyzing requirements and designing a solution for the VA EHR. The decision to integrate the VA's EHR with DoD’s EHR system was announced after the award of this EHRM Call. Since DMDC is already in the process of modernizing DoD‘s EHR system, the Secretaries of Defense and the Veteran‘s Administration directed DMDC to Immediately begin working on the integration of VA's MHS EHR system requirements into the DoD's EHR under the EHR modernization Call. ES ls currently supporting EHRM, after competing for the award. As the current contractor supporting this effort, E5 is the only source capable of performing the work requer to integrate the VA electronic health records into the DoD's EHR system, due to the fact that this requirement and the software releases required are within scope of the Call awarded to ES, and E8 is the only contractor permitted access to the code and the EHR databases. No other contractor can be given access to the EHR system or the code written to develop the modernized JEHR, which would create a security hole and conﬂict of Interest. The Government cannot allow another contractor to come in and take over the responsibility of the VA portion only while E5 is working on the modernization of the entire system. Besides the above security issue, the support of EHRM is the sustainmenl and modernization of EHR to the enhanced system JEHR, which will now include supporting the VA. ES has been providing this support since the award in September 2018, during which enhancements have been released and scheduled for the modernization effort. This VA Page 2 of 4 EHRM ID03180011 02/14/2019 requirement will affect some of these upcoming enhancements. as well as the ones already implemented; since the VA EHR processes and data must be integrated all releases will either have to be re-coded and/or rescheduled to include the changes required for the VA. ES is the only contractor that is directly in the process of coding these enhancements and releases, and, as such, is the only contmctor capable of rewriting the existing code for each release in a timely manner, in order to be able to implement the JEHR as soon as possible. Another contractor will need to be brought up to speed on E8’ code and integrated into the release management schedule, as well as having to follow ES‘ procedures and approvals for writing the code required. Requiring ES to train and approve a different contractor's work will take a great deal of coordination in a very tight schedule. ES must also continue the modernization of JEHR, while simultaneously making changes to existing processes to make the JEHR compatible with the VA. Brining in another contractor at this point could negatively affect the project plan developed by ES, because E5 is the only contractor involved in this modemization effort and rushing to assist anolher contractor to implement the small VA piece of the overall DoD EHR system would impact the level of quality and ability to meet established tlmelines. ES is the only contractor capable of providing the service required to integrate the VA vw'th the JEHR, because ES is the only contractor that has the experience, knowledge, particularly of the new code they recently wrote, and security position to do the work. If this were competed. the Government would not be able to mitigate the security and conﬂict of interest risks that would occur by bringing in a new contractor for this piece of work that E8 is able to perform immediately and with the expertise that only they have in the current environment. Also, if this requirement were competed, the Government would incur a signiﬁcant investment in the time and effort it would take to develop an entirely new set of solicitation documentation, Issue an RFQ, review and analyze quotes, prepare award documentation and make the award, In addition, competing this requirement could take months resulting in further delays of implementation. ES has provided acceptable support for this Call since September 2018 (no negative feedback has been received thus far from DMDC). Retaining this contractor is necessary to fulfill the Government‘s requirement of integrating the VA onto the same electronic health record platform as the DoD. The reasons above prove that competing this work will have an impact on DMDC's mission In modernizing the current EHR system to the DoDNA Joint Electronic Health Record management system. 5. Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Ofﬁcer that the Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with FAR 8.404(d): The assigned GSA Project Manager will complete a technical evaluation on the contractor's technical submission. The assigned GSA Contracting Ofﬁcer will complete the price evaluation. The GSA Project Manager will perform a technical evaluation to ensure that the labor mix and number of hours quoted by the contractor are acceptable and commensurate with the work requirement of this Call as well as ensuring that the contractor has adequately responded to all technical requirements. The GSA Contracting Officer will conduct a price analysis of the contractor's submitted prices for all labor Page 3 of 4 EHRM |DDa1BDD11 02(14/2019 6. ensuring that there are no math errors or pricing caveats. Quoted labor rates will also be checked to ensure that they do not exceed the contraclor's current GSA DMDC lTPS BPA contract rates. In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4, GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable at time of award of this Call since they are derived from and reﬂect the actual prices in the Enterprise Services LLC awarded DMDC iTPS BPA labor category rates and since the rates were also derived from a competitive acquisition. The Contracting Ofﬁcer has determined that this effort will result in the greatest overall benefit to the Government in response to the requirement. attaining the best value, and fair and reasonable prices. Description of Market Research: Market Research was conducted in accordance with FAR 10. A review of the technical scope of Enterprise Services LLC DMDC ITPS BPA contract showed that the contractor offers the required services under its DMDC ITPS BPA contract number GSMQHDSAOOOS. . Other Facts Supporting the Justiﬁcation: None. Actions the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers that Led to the Restricted Consideration prior to Subsequent Acquisition For the Supplies or Services: If future expenditures and allowances are granted for continued support during the period of performance of this Call. all efforts will be made by the Government to seek alternate sources of service for the support. However, it is important to note that many variables will play into this alternative source potential, such as changes in Government priorities within the current operations, and shifting needs.

Nature/Description of Contract Action: Request authority to Act under this Justiﬁcation to conduct this procurement of the Multiple Award Schedule Program (Title 41 U.S.C. l52 (3) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies). This is a limited source action to be awarded as a new Federal Supply Schedule order to a Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Business, Coley & Associates, Inc. The placement of a ﬁrm ﬁxed price order is anticipated. Turning Technologies has acknowledged that Coley & Associates, Inc. is the only authorized GSA holder of their product. Following the order of precedence in FAR 8.002 and FAR 8.004. The Government will adhere to the priority use of Government supply sources and solicit to Coley & Associates, Inc. a GSA schedule holder. They are also a Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Business. 3. Description of Reguired Supplies: The proposed procurement action is to support the Naval Science (NS-1) curriculum of the NSTC NJ ROTC program. It is intended to acquire student handheld response Radio Frequency (RF) Clickers and RF Receivers. These commercial items are patented, licensed, with warranty and available from a small business original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Turning Technologies, LLC. Based on market research and conﬁrmation via email dated 13 March 20l9 from Turning Technologies, LLC Point of Contact (POC) Sonel Freeman, Coley & Associates, Inc. is the only authorized GSA contract holder for these items, The estimated delivery date is 20 weeks after receipt of Order. The estimated dollar value, based on the Independent Government Estimate (ICE) is $572,985.00 for 9,987 RF Response Cards and 75 RF Receivers. Fiscal Year 19 0&M funds are available. J&A Number: 119-005 4. Statutou Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Ogn Competition: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program (Title 41 U.S.C. 153 (3) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies). Authority to limit sources to less than those required by FAR 8.405-1 and 8.405-2 is found at FAR 8.405-6(a)(l)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. 5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutog Authority: The NJROTC. Naval Science One (NS-1) curriculum is supported with Turning Technologies, LLC. (OEM) CPS system consisting of RF Clickers and RF Receivers. The CPS Systems was and is used for an average of 3 to 5 hours per day and approximately 3 days per week per classroom in 12 to 1200 classrooms over a 15-year period. The CPS system allows at least 1200 instnictors to deliver the curriculum to an estimate of 90,000 cadets in the NJ ROTC program. All student’s assessments, unit quizzes and exams are administered through the use of the CPS system. This system generates a saving of 500 man-hours per instructor, per year. Only Turning Technologies, LLC is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work. On the dates speciﬁed within the table below, Naval Supply Systems Command Fleet Logistic Center Jacksonville has Jrocured Turning Technologies proprietary CPS systems for NSTC NJROTC. Contract Number Purchased Date Amount of Award N68836-12—F-0432 29 AUG 2012 $698,227.20 N68836—13—F-0212 18 JUL 2013 $608,661.03 N68836-lS—P-0345 15 SEP 2015 $499,362.40 N68836-16-P-1096 28 SEP 2016 $499,966.25 N68836-17-P-0410 7 APR 2017 $499,986.00 N68836-18-F—0410 30 SEP 2018 $508,828.00 Total Cost $3,315,030.88 As stated from the chart above the NSTC NJROTC currently has over $3.3M in Turning Technologies Inc. proprietary CPS systems. The estimated dollar value of the additional capacity, RF Clickers and RF Receivers, is only an additional 17% of the existing systems already purchased. A substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition would result if procurement was competed. This procurement will add capability and replace some older RF Clickers that are no longer covered under warranty. Additionally, this procurement will allow greater student access by providing two classrooms to function simultaneously. The replacement cost of an entire new system would be over $3.3M and the human cost would be astronomical. Training and re-familiarization with an alternate system for 1200 instructors to learn a completely new system would be an additional cost. A redesign of the prime system and resultant preparation of new plans to replace the prime equipment is completely uneconomical and cost prohibited to the Government. J&A Number: 119-005 6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Praeticable: A Sources Sought Notice (SSN) was posted on NECO by Danielle Diuger on 25 Jan 2019 with a response date of 30 Jan 2019. No responses were received. Turning Technologies and Coley & Associates Inc were contacted via email to conﬁrm they could perform the work, and both conﬁrmed they were able to supply the items of this requirement. Based upon the market research and prior contract awards market research concluded a Sole Source Request for Quote (RFQ) will be solicited as a 100%, to GSA contract holder and a Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Business: Coley & Associates, Inc. 7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost: GSA has determined that prices of supplies of the scheduled contracts to be fair and reasonable for the purpose of establishing the scheduled contract. Therefore, ordering activities are responsible to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing for individual orders, BPA’s and orders under BPA‘s. The Contracting Ofﬁcer will make a determination of fair and reasonable pricing after receipt of the contractors quote before awarding a contract. 3. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers To Competition: For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NSTC NJROTC has no plans at this time to compete future contacts for the types of supplies covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NAVSUP FLC Jacksonville will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. 9, Contracting Point of Contact: The point of contact at NAVSUP Jacksonville Florida is Danielle Dinger code 232, at (904) 542- 1254 or by e-mail at Danielle.dinger@navy.mil.

Bangladesh has had success in expanding access to education, particularly with regard to gender parity, as 50.9% of all enrolled students were girls in 2016 and at least 60% of all govemment primary school teachers were women. The country has also achieved near universal net primary enrollment with over 97.9% of primary school age children enrolled in school. However, the quality of education across Bangladesh remains low. USAlD/Bangladesh commissioned a Rapid Education Risk Analysis in 2018 to gauge the impact of the Rohingya inﬂux on six upazilas in Cox’s Bazar‘. However, there is not enough current information on how other districts near Cox’s Bazar, such as Bandarban, have been impacted by the inﬂux, especially in the education sector. According to the 2017 Annual Sector Performance Reportz, student lcaming outcomes in Bandarban’s 219 government primary schools are in the top half of all districts nationwide,3 At the same time, the district has a per capita income of $290 and is one of the poorest districts of Bangladesh. About 84% of households rely on ﬁrewood for cooking fuel.‘ Request for Information Through this RFI, USAID/Bangladesh seeks to better understand the challenges and opportunities to primary education in Bandar‘ban District, and the landscape of partners who have institutional capability in the district’s education sector.

What can be done to overcome those challenges? 3. What are the languages of instruction in Bandarban, and do students use and understand those languages? QUALITY: It What aspects should be prioritized to improve quality in Bandarban schools? 2‘ Are there any opportunities to engage the private sector in improving quality and access to education in Bandarban? PROGRAMJVIIN G: 1. Considering the current economic, social and political situation, how can USAID programming in Bandarban lead to better primary education outcomes? 2. What is your organization’s experience, best practices, and lessons learned from working in Bandarban or the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT)? 3.

(It) /Ot(\"l‘()RS TO BE EVALUATED. The prospective contractor will provide responses to three factors to be evaluated: Factor I — TECHNICAL APPROACI I, The 'I‘echnieal Approach consists ofthree subfactors which will each be evaluated separately for acceptability. The industrial secttrity . bfaetor will be evaluated ﬁrst on a Pass/Fail b . A Quoter that does not rec vc a rating of \"Pass\" for the industrial security suhfactor will be removed from the competition, Factor ll - PAST PERFORMANCE Factor III — PRICE (c) EVALUATION APPROACH. The two categories for evaluation: technical and past performance will be all be evaluated for acceptability, Once an acceptable rating for technical and past performance has been met. the Quoter with the lowest price will be the single deciding factor for award. The overarching evaluation approach forall factors is as follows: Adequacy of Response: The quote will be evaluated to determine whether the Quoter's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered. defined. and satisﬁed the requirements speciﬁed in the PWS. The quote will be evaluated to detennine the extent and accuracy to which the requirement has been addressed in accordance with FAR 52.2l2-l ADDENDUM. Feasibility oprproach: The quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the Quoter is expected to be able to successfully complete the proposed tasks and technical requirements within the required schedule. (:1) NON-PRICE FACTORS Page 5 0f37 Factor I: Technical Approach The Government will evaluate the technical approach to determine whether the Quoter’s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered. deﬁned. and satisﬁed the requirements speciﬁed in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Quoter shall clearly state in its quote how it intends to accomplish this contract. Mere acknowledgment or restatement ofa requirement or task is not acceptable and offerors are cautioned that \"parroting\" of the Technical requirements or the PWS with a statement of intent to perform daex not reﬂect an understanding oflhe requirements or capability to perform. The following criteria shall be used during the evaluation process to detennine acceptability: Subtactor ]: Industrial Security a ‘I s factor will be evaluated on a PASS/FAIL basis. lfa Quoter does not meet the security clearance requirements. a \"Fail\" rating will be applied and this offer will not be further evaluated. Subt‘actor 2: Pert‘ormance/Management Approach 0 The performance approach narrative provided in the quote submission adequately describes and presents a clear understanding ofall requirements speciﬁed in Section 3.0 of the PWS. - The quote demonstrates that the Quoter's methods and approach in meeting the tasks is practicable. The Quoters management and oversight approach is clearly articulated in such a way as to present a clear understanding of personnel requirements. Suhfactor 3: Corporate Experience 0 The corporate experience presented by each Quolcr shall he used to assess the extent of the Quoter’s experience perfonning the tasks identiﬁed in the PW 'he government will evaluate whether the Quoter‘s corporate experience demonstrates 'xperlence performing the same or similar tasks/scope ofthe satire magnitude or size as what is required in the PWS. The acceptability ratings for Subfactors 2 and 3 are identiﬁed in Table A-l. Quotes will be cvalttated against the minimum requirements as identiﬁed above, Using the ratings and descriptions outlined in Table A-1. the Government will determine whether the Quoter‘s response is \"Acceptable“ or \"Unacceptable\". In order to receive an overall “Acceptable“ rating in Factor l»chhnical Approach. the Quoter must be receive a rating of“Pass\" for Subfactor l and \"Acceptable\" in Subfaetors 2 and 3. TableA-l: Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings Rating Description Acceptable An acceptable quote involves addressing the stated requirements under the Perfonnance/Management Approach Suhfactor and showing it has Corporate Experience performing tasks that are similar in size and scope to what is required in the PWS. Unacceptable Quote does not meet all stated requirements under the Performance/Management Approach Subfactor and has not shown prior Corporate Experience ofa similar scope and magnitude. Factor ll: Past Performance The past performance evaluation results in an assessment ofthe Quoter‘s probability ofmeeting the minimum past performance sol tation requirements. The assessment is based on the Quoter‘s record of Page 6 of37 recent and relevant past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. Tlte main component ofthis evaluation is to determine how well tlte Quoter has performed under recent/relevant contracts. The Government may use data provided by tile Quoter in its quote (from the Corporate Experience attd Past Performance Information Forms) and data obtained from other source ‘tcluding data in Govemment files or data obtained through interviews with personnel familiar with the contractor and their current and past perfonnauce under Federal. State or Local government or commercial contracts for same or similar services as compared to the North American Industry Classiﬁcation System (NAICS). Table A-2: Past Performance Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings Rating Description Acceptable Au acceptable response is one that demonstrates a reasonable expectation that the Quoter will successfully perfomt the required etTon or that the Quoter's performance record is unknown. Unacceptable An unacceptable response is one that does not demonstrate a reasonable expectation that the otferor will stlccessfullj'_perform the required effon. *NOTE: In the case ofa Quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the otieror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore. the Quoter shall be determined to have unknown (or \"neutral\" past performance. In the context ofacceptabiIity/unaceeptability. a neutral rating shall he considered “acceptable“. Factor III: Price Price will be evaluated on the basis ot’pricc reasonableness. Price reasonableness pertains to the Quoter‘s ability to project a price which is realistic and indicates that the Quoter understands the nature and scope of work to be performed All prices proposed in Attachment 2 — Exhibit Line Item Pricing Spreadsheet. including the option permitted under FAR 52.217-8. will be evaluated for price reasonableness in accordance with FAR l3. l06»3. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total prices for all live years. and the six month extension via FAR 52.2l7-8. The evaluated price ol'the option under FAR 52.2]7»8 will be calculated by the Govenunent at 50% ofthc total price for Year 5. Price will be evaluated as the discriminating factor amongst all quotes that Itave been determined to meet the requirements as stated above. A price evaluation may not be conducted on quotes which do not meet the requirements.

If this contract is covered by the E0, the contractor must provide employees with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill, injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections under the E0 is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts. ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.48 per hour or $179.20 per week or $776.53 per month HEALTH & WELFARE E0 13706: $4.18 per hour, or $167.20 per week, or $724.53 per month* *This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA— covered contract also covered by E0 13706, Establishing Paid sick Leave for Federal Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any paid sick leave provided pursuant to E0 13706. VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor, 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174) THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.E‘.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the https://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scaﬁlcs/std/ 1 5-5489.txt?v=7 4/3/2019 Page 9 ofll conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1] The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2] The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.E‘.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.ei occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). *\" HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL ** An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder, All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: Imps ://www.wdol .gov/wdol/scaﬁles/std/l 5-5489.|xt?v=7 4/3/2019 Page 10 ofll The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or 5.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of \"wash and wear\" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. ** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS ** The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\", Fifth Edition (Revision 1), dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated. “' REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444) ** Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall. require that any ciass of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b](2](i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (see 29 CFR 4.6(b) (2) (11)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b) (2) (v)) . When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF—1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) when preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s] and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent https://www.wdol.gov/wdol/smﬁles/std/l 5-5489.txt?v=7 4/3/2019 Page 11 ofll information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(h)(2)(ii)). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request . 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the contractor. 6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See 29 CPR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)). Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(l))v https://www.wdoLgovlwdollscaﬂles/std/15-5489.txt‘?v=7 4/3/2019"}

FDA requires a sole source extension to contract # HHSF223201610640A to provide Empirica Signal Suite Operations and Maintenance (0&M) Support for dynamic, visual data mining environment for detecting signals, uncovering patterns, and recognizing emerging trends in adverse event report data including quantitative data mining of the MEDLINE indexing for novel drugvadverse event safety signal detection, b. Project background. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has the challenging task of provrding regulatory oversight to the world’s largest and most technologically advanced pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The oversight of global operations for new drug development is heavily reliant on the availability and analysis of electronic data at every stage of the drug life-cycle. Thus, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Translational Science established the Data Mining and Informatics Evaluation and Research Group (CDER/OTS/DMIER) to support the needs of the CDER review community, their scientific review processes, and associated scientific computing Justification and Approval for Sole Source — FAR 13.501(a) efforts. in particular, DMIER is focused on changing how data from regulatory submissions are acquired, stored, and analyzed in order to provide more quantitative-based decisions. CDER scientific reviewers presently use data analysis tools in Empirica Signal for pharmacovigilance to support the scientiﬁc review of clinical trial data and post market safety data. The FDA reviewers uses Empirica Signal to help manage their drug and product safety proactively and strategically in drug approval and post market surveillance. Empricia Signal uses modern computing and state-of—the»art statistical algorithms to sift through millions of suspected reaction reports and thousands of products to look for potential safety signals needing further scrutiny. E Signal was developed to aid safety evaluators and reviewers in FDA CDER and CBER to explore data mining and data visualization techniques analyze spontaneous reports of adverse reactions pertaining to drugs, biologics and vaccines, We recently further developed E. Signal to optimize our evaluation resources and enhance our ability to identify drug-related safety concerns. Through the use of enhanced data mining techniques we improve our current ability to identify adverse event patterns in post-market safety databases. The improved data mining tools provided FDA with even earlier detection of safety signals associated with marketed products, especially adverse events from drug-drug interactions’. 3.

Contracting Activity: Army Contracting Command—Warren (ACC-WRN) is the procuring activity for this action. 2. Description of Action: ACC-WRN proposes to negotiate and award a modification to contract W56HZV-15-C-0099 with BAE Systems Land & Armaments (BAE), to add 5.530.404 hours to the existing contract and to extend the ﬁve-year period of performance by two years from 09 July 2020 to 08 July 2022. In addition. this contract action will add vehicles managed by Project Manager Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (PM AMPV). This contract currently provides System Technical Support (STS) and Sustainment System Technical Support (SSTS) services for Bradley Fighting Vehicle System (BFVS) Family of Vehicles (FOV), Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Carrier. M113 FOV. and all den'vatives of those vehicles. The Government will fund this action utilizing Other Procurement. An'ny. Operation and Maintenance Army, Research. Development. Test. and Evaluation. Army Working Capital Fund, and Foreign Military Sales funding depending on the individual effort The contract type for the proposed modiﬁcation will be a combination of Cost Plus Fixed Fee completion and Level of Effort. same as the existing contract. 3. Description of Supplies/Services: This modiﬁcation will allow for critical STS and SSTS services to be provided for vehicles managed by PM AMPV. and continuation of those services for the Project Manager Armored Fighting Vehicles (PM AFV). These services include engineering. logistics. and fielding support for BFVS FOV. AMPV FOV, MLRS Carrier.

The contract is currently valued at $332,321 ,328 and the total dollar value of this modification is estimated to $770,016,115; therefore, anticipated total contract value with this modification is $1,1B ($332,321,328 + $770,016,115) The estimate for this action is based on an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) dated 11 May 2017‘ The breakdown by ﬁscal year is as follows: The need for substantial additional hours is based on forecasted STS requirements for future Bradley, MLRS and M113 programs that were not anticipated at the time of contract award in July 2015, The requirements include Bradley Engineering Change Proposals (ECPS) for improved track and suspension, mobility and lethality, as well as Army directed requirements for an Active Protection System, and Under Belly Interim Solution. These ECPs will restore lost capability and ensure future Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform, requiring engineering, testing, and fielding support under the STS/SSTS contract The forecasted requirements also include Vehicle Version Identiﬁcation (WID) hardware and software upgrades, continuing obsolescence mana ement, and fieldin su port to Arm and CMO Control Number: 2016-031 4. Authority Cited: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, \"Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.\" Specifically. FAR 6.302- 1(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) provides that “Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow—on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in — (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulﬁlling the agency’s requirements\" 5. Reason for Authority Cited: a) BAE Systems. as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and sole producer ofthe BFVS FOV, AMPV, MLRS Carrier, M113 FOV, and all derivatives thereof, is the only contractor with the immediate engineering and logistics experience required to support the vehicles. The STS/SSTS program involves extensive vehicle support tasks that include Program Management, Logistics, Engineering, Configuration Management, Product Assurance and Test (PAT), and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMi) related tasks. No otherfirm except BAE, is capable of meeting the Army‘s needs and no other source possesses the technical data and documentation needed to fully support the vehicles within the required timeframe. Additionally, BAE Systems currently maintains conﬁguration control and overall system design of the BFVS FOV, AMPV, MLRS Carrier, M113 FOV, and all derivatives thereof. BAE Systems has the engineering expertise with experienced personnel capable of developing timely and accurate responses to issues arising on complex software and electrical systems, armor requirements, ammunition, turrets, and system integration of the vehicles. BAE is also responsible for obsolescence planning and timely replacement of Impolanl Ilal ll! manage sogare upgrales to egacy la!ware systems. BAE has engineers in each field of vehicle design with years of experience 5 CMO Control Number: 2018-031 working on each vehicle system. A new firm attempting to develop the engineering expertise to efficiently and effectively respond to the multitude of mechanical, electrical, and armored structural design issues across these vehicle systems, would have to learn various subsystems on each vehicle. This would result in added expenditures to pay a new contractor to learn each vehicle system, and would require additional time for a new ﬁrm to respond to field issues, possibly causing vehicles to be dead-lined for indeterminate periods. b) BAE Systems, as the OEM and current contractor for the subject vehicles, developed and maintains the only existing collection of technical information on the various vehicles and major subsystems, including technical analysis, trade-off studies, and problem investigation reports. BAE has more than 20 years of vehicle production experience, and is responsible for obsolescence planning and timely replacement of hardware, software, and firmware as part of conﬁguration control of the vehicle design. in addition, as the prime contractor for the Bradley, MLRS, M113 and AMPV vehicles, BAE is responsible for ensuring the correct versions of software are obtained from vendors and conﬁrming the software is compatible with new vehicle configurations. c) A complete TDP sufficient for competitive vehicle procurement (including drawings and descriptions of required material preparation processes), has not been acquired for the entire life cycle of Bradley vehicles and the MLRS Carriert BAE developed the vehicles. and has consistently refused to sell the bulk of its TDP since that TDP forms the basis for its current and future business. Selected technical data has been obtained for use by the Army to support material supply and sustainment actions. A complete TDP sufficient for competitive vehicle procurement has not been e) While the Government has unlimited rights in some M113 FOV technical data, a complete TDP and Software Data Package sufficient for competition has not been acquired for the M113 FOV; in fact, there is no single data package that fully defines the entire baseline M113 vehicle. All technical data forthe M113A‘I and M113A2 variants has been modified to support the M113A3 variant only. CMO Control Number: 2018031 BAE is able to support the M113 FOV based on the technical data it has, as well as on its extensive past experience manufacturing and supporting the FOV. Therefore, no contractor other than BAE would be able to technically support the M113 vehicle variants. The tables below depict the duplication of cost and unacceptable delay that would be incurred if another source was to perform STS and SSTS services for . v are common acrosst e ve ic e systems an cou be accomplished concurrently. each listed task would still have to be performed on each vehicle system The PM offices developed the estimated length of time using both combat vehicle history from the Bradley and AMPV FOV and a bottom-up approach by identifying the tasks to be performed, the number of people necessary to execute the effort and the man-years required to perform the tasks, In order to generate the costs listed in the chart below, actual historical AMPV and Bradley contract data along with an in-house Government engineering analysis was conducted to estimate duplicate costs necessary to perform each task. CMO Control Number: 2018-031 , l Iona sources WOU have to be developed. This would include the Government’s development of the requirement, through the additional sources’ demonstration(s) of technical expertise. Technical Data and Computer Software, Logistics Data and documentation for Vehicle Systems: This task is reflected in the charts above for each vehicle system. The additional time and duplication of oost can be attributed to the period associated with the need to redesign and qualify legacy components for which the Government does not have technical data due to on-going obsolescence redesigns, design upgrades and safety upgrades. In order to accomplish this, another contractor would need to develop complete design parameters for legacy components. BAE has the design parameters documented, along with Computer Aided Design (CAD) models, and performance models for the entire vehicle and each Line Replacement Unit (LRU) interface. The development and delivery of technical drawings and logistic data required to field new systems are reﬂected in the charts above. These estimates include reverse engineering of vehicle and LRU modules, prototype builds; development of design criteria, CAD models, and development of performance models. Build Test Vehicles: Any new contractor would be required to build and test prototype vehicles. The estimated time and money required to build and test these various vehicle systems are reflected in the charts above. These estimates include time and costs to validate that the technical data developed CMO Control Number: 2018-031 by a new contractor is complete and dimensionally correct, all models are sufﬁcient, and all manufacturing processes are sufficient. The development of these manufacturing and production processes involves tooling and includes qualifying vehicle components Once these items are completed, the new contractor‘s processes and manufacturing capabilities would have to be established by First Article Test. iii) Vehicle Operational Performance Testing: Any new contractor is required to verify new designs through manufacturing. The estimated time and money required to test the various systems are reﬂected in the charts above. Vehicle Operational Performance Testing includes the vehicles’ performance capability to verify all parts of the vehicles function and meet all requirements called out in the performance speciﬁcation for each platform. Reliability and Maintainability testing is required for any new vehicle configuration. and is included in the estimates. iv) STS Source Selection: Afterthe veriﬁcation of additional sources, a competitive source selection, limited to those veriﬁed additional sources, would be initiated for the actual STS effort. This task is reflected in the charts above for all vehicle platforms but only one source selection would be required and would include all vehicle platforms The time included for RFP development, in addition to the time required to execute a best value source selection in accordance with the Source Selection Practical Guide is not included in the timeframe referred to above. v) Total Time and Cost: Though some of the tasks can be accomplished concurrently, because all tasks would be required for all four vehicle systems, based on the above, it would cost the Army approximately $1 .73 total for all four vehicle systems, and cause a delay of approximately 54 months total for all vehicle platforms to bring a new contractor to the level at which BAE is currently operating. The above estimates are based on historical actual data from the AMPV and Bradley programs which take into account a new vehicle design that started with very minimal design data. 9) The total additional funding of$1.7B and delay of 54 months total for all vehicle platforms is unacceptable to the respective programs. Any delay would negatively impact the Army and national security. STS/SSTS services must continue in order to address roduction and fieldin schedules, as well as CMO Control Number. 2018-031 delay, awarding this effort to a source other than BAE would result in a substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition. h) The estimated cost to be recovered through competition does not justify competing this requirement. The Government estimates it would incur a total of The Government does not anticipate being able to realize this savings based on previous competitive procurements on other programs of similar size and complexity. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: a. Effective competition: For the reasons stated above, effective competition is not anticipated for this acquisition. b. Subcontracting competition: At the subcontract level, BAE will be required to select subcontractors on a competitive basis to the maximum practical extent consistent with FAR clause 52.244-5. Competition in Subcontracting. 7. Actions to Increase Competition: In the future, and where cost effective, the Government will attempt to procure technical data that would allow forfull and open competition. 8. Market Research: PM AFV and PM AMPV conduct market research on a regular basis in orderto determine if other contractors are able to provide the services required under this effort. Pursuant to FAR 10.002(b)(2) (i) and (ii), a market survey was issued on 17 March 2017. in the form of a Sources Sought Notice, to determine whether new sources are capable of performing the tasks currently included under the Bradley STS contract. The initial market survey was released covering BFVS FOV, M113 FOV, Bradley Fire Support Team (BFIST) vehicle. and MLRS vehicles. The survey was amended on 25 April 2017 to include AMPV vehicles; it closed on 10 May 2017. The market survey addressed all major tasks, including the following: 0 Program Management: Describe your company‘s experience and tools to manage project cost. schedule, and performance. 10 CMO Control Number: 2018-031 Configuration Management (CM): Describe your company’s CM Process, tools to perform Configuration Management of the Technical Data Package, and experience in Conﬁguration Management. Systems Engineering: Describe your company’s experience and tools to manage requirements, develop speciﬁcations, assess and track risk. and address parts obsolescence. Software Engineering: Describe your company’s level of certification, processes, and experience in managing software requirements, development. test, fielding and sustainment support. Describe your company’s experience developing and verifying embedded diagnostics software on vehicles with an electronic architecture. System Validation/Testing: Describe your company’s experience performing subsystem and vehicle level integration, assembly, test, and checkout. What is your company‘s experience performing hardware/software integration and troubleshooting? ILS Management: Describe your company's experience in developing and updating logistics support products for integrated vehicle systems. What is your company’s experience with obsolescence and continuing support for vehicles in light of these issues? What is your company’s process to ensure the vehicle system remains supportable through spare parts, maintenance, and logistics documents as the configuration changes? ll CMO Control Number: 2018-031 In May 2017, PM AFV subject matter experts (SME) performed an analysis of the responses. The SME team identified six areas which have a direct influence on whether the responder is capable of performing as a prime contractor for the STS/SSTS contract, Although the Market Survey generated six responses from potential vendors. the team eliminated ﬁve as sources who could satisfy the immediate requirement. The SME team found that only BAE possesses the available resources with sufficient and successful past experience to meet the required STS/SSTS program deliverablest No other vendor has the technical data to immediately perform this effort 9. interested Sources: As mentioned above, six sources responded to the market survey, but only one firm (BAE), was determined to be the only viable source. All notices required by FAR 5.201 will be published, as appropriate, in conjunction with this acquisition and any proposals will be considered 10. Other Facts: a. Procurement history (PM AFV): The following contracts are STS/SSTS for Bradley FOV, MLRS Carrier, and M113 FOV, and derivatives thereof. There is no STS/SSTS procurement history for the AMPV FOV; the only procurement history for AMPV FOV is contract W56HZV-15-C-A001, competitively awarded on 23 December 2014, as a Research Development Test and Evaluation contract for Engineering and Manufacturing Development 1.

J&A History: A Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition was approved (CMO 14-089) on 29 June 2014 by the Senior Procurement Executive for the award of contract W56HZV-15-C-0099. Paragraph 7, Actions to Increase Competition, states that “BAE is the designer. developer, and manufacturer of the BFVS FOV, MLRS Carrier, and M113 FOV. It has the requisite vehicle systems knowledge and experience of design and performance. and is the only practical source that can provide the technical and logistics support for the Bradley program variants. BAE will be required with all future awards to maximize competition as required by FAR 52244-5 Competition in Subcontracting. This action will be synopsized and the prime contractor will be required to submit a subcontracting plan. It will be evaluated and BAE‘s goals will be negotiated, if necessary. The Government has no plans to increase competition beyond synopsizing the acquisition.” 3. No prior contract for this STS/SSTS requirement was accomplished using full and open competition As noted in section 10.a.1, above, all previous contracts were awarded on a sole source basis using the authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1. 4. No unusual patterns were revealed by the procurement history, 5 The circumstances justifying the previous J&A were based on the fact that only BAE has the engineering expertise and experienced personnel'capable of developing timely and accurate responses to issues BAE is the developer, producer and current oontractorfor all technical services of the BFVS, M113 and MLRS Carrier. BAE has total system responsibility for the vehicle systems and 13 CMO Control Number. 2018-031 provides overall configuration management and engineering support for subsystems. BAE developed and maintains the only existing complete collection of technical information on the various vehicles and major subsystems, including technical analysis, trade—off studies, and problem investigation reports.

Identiﬁcation of the Agency and Contracting Activity: Defense Health Agency (DHA), Component Acquisition Executive, J-4, National Capital Region-Contracting Division (NCR- CD. HT0014), 8111 Gatehouse Road, Falls Church, VA 22042. 2. Nature and/or Description of Action being approved: Approval is requested for an 18- month bridge contract for Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) support at various locations worldwide. The estimated dates for this requirement are from 26 March 2019 through 25 September 2020. The planned periods ofperformance are as follows: 6-month base period from 26 March to 25 September 2019, followed by four, 3-month options which will be exercised only as needed. The total estimated cost ofthis requirement is including the FAR 52,217-8 6-month extension. This requirement will be a sole source contract utilizing the incumbent contractor, General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. (GDIT), to provide health care providers. clinical care coordinators, clinical investigators, educators and others to assist and facilitate the execution ofthe DVBIC missions and tasks to achieve program objectives and goals, consistent with the description ofthe work and position descriptions. 3. Description of Supplies/Services: This requirement provides for support promoting access to state-of-the-seience-eare for service members, veterans and their families, to prevent and mitigate the consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). DVBIC was founded in 1992, largely in response to the first Persian Gulf War, under the name Defense and Veterans Head Injury Program. At the time. its goal was to integrate specialized TBI care, research and education across military and veteran medical care systems. DVBIC now supports a network of 23 sites operating out of 18 military Lreatment facilities and 5 Department ofVeterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Specific activities vary at each site and can include conducting clinical research. providing clinical support and care to service members, assisting service members and veterans and their families, locating support services, conducting education and outreach activities and assessing TBI injury data, while command and control exist with the DVBIC Headquarters (HQ) for continuity ofserviees, 4. Statutory Authority Cite Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(l). as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). This is applicable when services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements. Full and open competition need not be provided for, and services may be deemed to be available from only the original source in the case offollow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services. This is applicable when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. 5. Reason for Authority Cited: GDIT is the proposed source for this requirement because. as the current contractor, they are presently performing the services satisfactorily and, due to the complexity ofthe DVBIC program, are the only readily available, responsible source capable of providing all the services by the required start date of 26 March 2019. The current contract was awarded to GDIT as a full and 0 en com etition contract. — ﬁ 'i'iie re-compeiing effon was initially publicized for market research purposes on 28 August 2018. and is currently being prepared for solicitation. The DVBIC program is going through major chan yes as directed b , J9t howevert and the re uirement is bein u dated com rehensivel . The .19 mandated changes have affected the acquisition timeline, necessitating a bridge action longer than the typical 12 months. The current contract expires 25 March 2019 with no options or extensions remaining. A bridge contract is required to continue services until the re-competing effort is awarded, and until operations can begin under the new contract. As the re-compete package is still being formalized, additional time is needed to ensure there is no disruption in these vital services. A bridge contract longer than 12 months is needed in the event the final requirement package takes longer to be received due to J9’s changing strategies, in case source selection takes longer than first expected, and in order to ensure services are continuously provided in the event of one or more protests. The four, 3-month options will be exercised only in the event more time is needed. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: The competitive. full and open solicitation for the current contractual support was issued in FY 2012. The current contract did not become effective until July 2014 because several protracted, post-award protests had to be resolved ﬁrst. and the process took 13 months after the initial award was made. A bridge contract is required to cover the requirement between the expiration of the current contract on 25 March 2019 and the start of main ~ WWW— _ The long-term contract will be rc-eompcted either as a full and open action, or as a small business set-aside. A ﬁnal decision has not been made yet. 7. Actions to Increase Competition: A competitive long-term ac uisition is in the development stages, and a solicitation is scheduled to be released— The bridge contract is necessary to provide for continuing services while the re- competing effort is solicited and awarded, and until operations can begin under the new contract, as a transition period will be necessary between vendors. 8. Market Research: In accordance with FAR Part 10, market research was conducted to determine the most suitable approach to acquiring supporting services and to determine if there are HUBZone, 8(a). Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SD85), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs), Women-Owned Small Businesses, other small businesses or large businesses available to provide the required services. Initial market research was performed from 28 August through 12 October 2018 for the new long-term contract: it was reviewed and used for the purpose ofdetermining the most suitable approach to obtain services under the contract. It consisted ofa combination of intemet research, reviewing ofthe current contract. conducting a Dynamic Small Business Search on the Small Business Administration website, as well as a sources sought first posted on FebBizOpps on 28 August 201 8, and an extension thereto posted on 11 September 2018. However, for this bridge contract. only one vendor, the incumbent, has been determined deﬁnitively capable ol'providing the entire requirement by 26 March 2019, having provided all of these services under the existing contract. Additionally, for the bridge sole source effort. a Special Notice ofthe Government’s intent to issue a sole source contract action was posted on FedBizOpps on 29 October 2018, with a required response or closing date of21 November 2018. As of} December 2018, no ﬁrms had indicated an interest in the short-term bridge contract by providing a response to the announcement. 9. Other Facts: a. Explanation ofwhy technical data packages, speciﬁcations, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available: Not applicable. The five-year long-term contract will be solicited in the near future, pending deﬁnition ofthe overall requirement and completion of the solicitation package. 7.

(Above Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT)) FAR PART 8 CONTRACTING ACTIVITY Requirement Originating Organization: Nuclear Energy Oak Ridge Site Ofﬁce Identification Number: 19NE000203 Contracting Officer: Mary Haiterman Phone: (865) 5763356 The Oak Ridge Ofﬁce (0R0) of the Department of Energy (DOE) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition. This document sets forth thejustiﬁcation and approval for the use ofa limited source allowed under the Multiple Award Schedule Program as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules. NATURE AND/0R DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED This contract action is for subject matter expert technical services in support of the Nuclear Energy Oak Ridge Site Ofﬁce (NE—ORso) The resultant award will be a noncompetitive modification to contract DE-DT0012605 (General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule no. GS-OOF-112CA) with Professional Project Services, inc. (ProZServe). The modification will increase the ceiling and extend the period of performance for up to 8 months to support DOE activities associated with the planning and execution of DOE missions. A time»and-materiais award type is anticipated for this action. Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6ia)(1)(i)(B), it has been determined only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the services are unique or highly specialized. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCV'S NEEDS Subject matter expert technical services are required to support DOE activities associated with the planning and execution of DOE missions associated with the Centrus»owned Advanced Centrifuge Plant equipment and DOE owned equipment. Additionally, support is required for inspection and accreditation of cyber security systems and programs in support of Interagency Agreements between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and DOE. This is a performance-based acquisition for services. The expected level of effort is approximately 2.5 fuil~time equivalents. The current period of performance for the order is December 4, 2016, through April 3, 2019. This noncompetitive modification will extend the contract from April 4, 2019 through December 3, 2019 to allow for continued support of DOE’s mission. The total estimated value/ ceiling of the current period of performance is $1,819,830, and the estimated value of the extension period is $959,728. The total estimated value of the contract action is $2,779,558. AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE FOR LIMITING SOURCES AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE CON'I'RACI'OR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY/SERVICE, IF APPLICABLE FAR 8.405-6 requires an ordering activity to justify its actions when restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405—2.

(Above Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT)) FAR PART 8 FAR 8.405~6(a)(1)(l)(B), \"Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.\" ProZServe has unique and directly applicable experience and a long term background associated with uranium enrichment via Gas Centrifuge technology and other Uranium Enrichment Technologies required for oversight/management activities of the NE-ORSO. ProZServe’s extensive prior experience in uranium enrichment supporting NE~ORSO in oversight of lease administration In Portsmouth and Oak Ridge has led to unparalleled programmatic knowledge of the application of centrifuge technology at those leased facilities. Given the unique aspects (i.e. knowledge, background, and required expertise) of the NE<ORSO mission, it is not reasonable to expect a new contractor will have the necessary expertise or the required in—depth knowledge to support the High Assay Low Enriched Uranium Demonstration Program without significant duplication of costs. This, coupled with ProZServe's experience and knowledge of the work and the ongoing interfaces with NE-ORSO and Centms, Urenco, Silex, and the NRC makes ProZServe uniquely qualiﬁed to perform the required services at the level of quality required. DETERMINATION BY THE ORDERING ACTIVITY CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) The contractor's rates were evaluated against other GSA schedule holders The proposed rates are in-line with similar GSA negotiated rates and include an additional discount ranging from two to 14 percent of the current rates under GSA contract GSOOF~112C The Contracting Ofﬁcer has determined that the order represents the best value to meet the Government's needs and the ceiling establlshed is an accurate estimate of the total effort required. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR EXPLAIN WHV MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED Market research was conducted via issuance of a notice of intent to award a noncompetitive modiﬁcation to ProZServe, thereby increasing the ceiling and extending the period of performance for up to 12 months. This notice was published on FedBizOpps.gov, Federal Business Opportunities website, and FedConnect.net. the Government Acquisition Portal on February 12, 2019. There were no responses received for this notice. Additional market research will be conducted to locate qualiﬁed sources to perform these services if the requirement continues beyond the contract period of performance.

ACAS IS an integrated software solution that provides automated network vulnerability scanning, conﬁguration assessment and network discovery. (3) Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs: The Mobile ACAS System to be procured has a total cost of _ - has the requirement to procure a mobile system that will scan computers for cyberrsecurity vulnerabilities, The system needs to be mobile (small, lightweight, and quickly deployable), have maximum secured stora e and can quickly and easily duplicate the current conﬁguration. The acquismon of the recommended hardware will allow .ho efficiently deploy this mobile requirement without changing the current configuration. This system avoids unnecessary delay of deployment and duplication of costs to reconfigure the new hardware, The requested ACAS system is the most cost effective, efficient and technological superior solution available that satisfies the Government's needs. (4) Justification for restricting consideration to a brandrname item: In order for _to acquire the Mobile ACAS System, required by the Government, the following brand name components must be purchased as integral parts ofthis system: The Dell PowerEdge R230 server is the only hardware configuration compatible with the existing baseline configuration. Acquisition of this server will ensure an exact hardware match which will allow to maintain one baseline conﬁguration; effectively doubling the current capability immediately. This server allows to quickly re-deploy the entire mobile assessment software configuration, alleviating the need and resources associated Witn manual configuration of the software.

The cost of acquiring the HP 22 Mini (34 Workstation— The StarTech Console, with a rack-mount KVM switch for mobile ACAS capability, is used to control the mobile ACAS server. This rack offers a KVM display in a slidable 1U rack mount form factor. This system requires a VGA compatible active matrix LCD display that supports a resolution of at least 1280 x 1024, along with a USB interface for the mouse and keyboard: therefore the name brand console best fits the Government‘s requirements. The cost of the 2 — KVM consoles Using OtherThan Requested (OTR) brands would be more expensive and incompatible with AFRL/RCCS requirements. Althou h other hardware solutions exist, none are compatible With the existing software, tools and utility customizations that lready has in place, These customizations were developed to reduce the manpower costs required to prepare, deploy and recover the Mobile ACAS system and its data before and after each use, Not acquiring the listed name-brand hardware would require additional resources and manpower to create the software and conﬁgure the tools and utility customizations necessary to ensure proper system operation when preparing, deploying and recovering the system, *to create the customizations for hardware, software, tools and utilities for OTR brand equipment, lso estimates an additional conﬁ uration chan e is made in order to maintain yet a second baseline image for the OTR brand hardware. onfiguration changes changes a year due to the mission of the Mobile ACAS System which must be kept updated due to the constantly changing cyber-environment.

All 3 vendors provided information on each software capabilities and how they diﬂered from FEKO. Other facts supporting sole source procurement: a, What other products were considered and why did they not meet the need? 0! the two competitors to FEKO. 680 did not provide a demonstration of electromagnetic interference (EMI) simulation issues solved using the product. For the ANS YS product, the vendor’s product would not simulate electromagnetic problems above 100 MHz without additional cost. Because neither of the competitor’s packages sufﬁciently simulate EMl for the frequencyrange of 10 Hz through 10 GHz, Altair’s FEKO is the preferred solution of best value to the government, b. What can this product do that other products cannot do? This product can simulate the entire range of EM! frequencies from 10 Hz to 10 GHz without the need to purchase additional sofiware or options.

If this contract is covered by the E0, the contractor must provide employees with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill, injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence. sexual assault, or stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections under the E0 is available at www.clol.gov/whd/govcontracts. ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.48 per hour or $179.20 per week or $776.53 per month HEALTH & WELFARE E0 13706: $4.18 per hour, or $167.20 per week, or $724.53 per month‘ ‘This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA- covered contract also covered by ED 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any paid sick leave provided pursuant to E0 13706, VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor, 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (See 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther Kinglr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day. Labor Day, Columbus Day. Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174) THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES lN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(1)), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualiﬁes as a bona ﬁde executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 CH}. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $2763 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determinations Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional speciﬁcations; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design speciﬁcations; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modiﬁcation of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 CPR. 541.400)‘ 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAV & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am, If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). ” HAZARDOUS PAV DIFFERENTIAL \" An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordnance, explosives. and incendiary materials This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordnance. (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been speciﬁcally designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. “ UNIFORM ALLOWANCE \" If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of \"wash and wear\" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor. by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs‘ \" SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORYOFOCCUPATIONS “ The duties of employees underjob titles listed are those described in the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\", Fifth Edition (Revision 1). dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated. \" REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard Form 1444 (SF>1444) \"‘ Conformance Process: The contracting ofﬁcer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract lie, the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classiﬁed by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (Let, appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i))l Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR4,6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a ﬁnal determination of conformed classiﬁcation, wage rate, and/or fringe beneﬁts which shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the ﬁrst day of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classiﬁcation. Failure to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed ratels), 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification titlels), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification[s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage ratels), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting ofﬁcer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the US Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)l2)(ii)). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting ofﬁcer, or notiﬁes the contracting ofﬁcer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the contractor. 6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See 29 cm 4.6(b)(2)(iii)). Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF»1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the \"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations\" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artiﬁcially split, combine, or subdivide classiﬁcations listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))i FAC 2005-10] EFF: 7/20/20] 8 VENDOR PAYMENT INFORMATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT OF PURCHASE ORDER: \"J Volt must receive a Purchase Order tor the supp .\"1 Before payment can be made ' ' IIIe \"DI; I IVI- .R 'IO'I dun: in Block Is oi the Purchase Order SF- “49 Form (_)r ' The “IF TO\" lltid in Block 6 (It the Purchase Order OF- 347 Form ... 8y. elll tor Amird Management (SAM) is moudalog' for payment oi‘purchase orders, ' Refer to [uni/JHHI.SIIIII.L't)\\ or plume l-8K8-227-2423I INVOICES‘ - ()I’lgllld mtochs arL requtred or payanL Howeter. a copy may be accepted ii‘murked ORIGINAL I Dn not send extra or multiple copies ol’llle invoice, This only delays processing, A PROPER INVOICE MUST CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING: Complete Business Name and Remittance Address IIW Number and Invoice Dale Requ . in Number in Block I on the SF- I449 g Requisilion Number in Block 4 on the OF- 347 Purchase Order Number in Block 4 on sl- I449 r Purchase Order Number in Block 3 on the 0F-347, Your DUNS number must be indicated on you voice helbre payment will be made.

CONTRACTING ACTIVITY Department ofthe Air Force 773 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) 35|5 S. General McMullen. Suite 200 San Antonio. TX 78226-1865 Purchase Request Number: FIATD43233A001 II. NATURE AND/0R DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED This Justiﬁcation and Approval (J&A) has been prepared to award a ﬁrm-ﬁxed price six (6) month extension ofservice modiﬁcation to Kingﬁsher Systems, Inc. who currently is the Prime on the existing contract, FA8052-l l-F-RVZO. The estimated value for the six (6) month extension is— for the period 000 Aug l3 — 28 Feb 14. This six month extension will allow sufficient time to adequately combine and compete the follow-on requirement. This action is necessary to mitigate a break in service. as on9 August 2013. for “Innovations Program Management Support\" for the Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA) SGSl Directorate requirements. Ofﬁce ofthe Air Force Surgeon General. Background lnfomation: In April. 20]} SOS] began the process of preparing a new acquisition package for the re-compete of the existing services. SGSI planned to continue contractor support through use ofthe 8 (a) competitive acquisition strategy. During the period April —— July 2013 the acquisition package was prepared and coordinated with the contracting activity. Due to very recent changes with the requirement. the acquisition strategy was changed. In August. discussions begin within $05 to possibly combine the Innovations Contract with an $05] Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARS) contract. To date. a well deﬁned follow-on requirement has not been established. Extending the current vendor avoids a break in service. Failure to extend services for six (6) months will result in the inability to support the clinical integration of personalized healthcare in the Air Force/DoD and the development ofnanotechnologies impacting Combat Casualty Care (JPC 6) and adversely affect AFMS/SGSl Innovations strategic planning capability. resulting in mission failure. III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY‘S NEEDS The primary purpose ofcontract FA8052~I l-F-RVZD is to provide Advisory and Assistance Services (A &AS) and Program Management (PM) Support to AFMS/SCSI Innovations. AFMS/SCSI Innovations: A&AS and PM suppon contract staff provides support to the AFMS E7 Objective owner. SGSI TAMS/Ponfolio Areas. and Military Health System (MHS) Innovations. Advisory. planning. management. and implementation support is provided for AFMS/SCSI Innovations program areas: Strategic Integration. lnnovations Portfolio 2 Management. Basic and Applied Research. and Data Analytics. The contract staff is responsible for leading and fulﬁlling the requirements of the AFMS Strategic Management Group E7 Objective Initiatives and for executing the Air Force strategy for medical innovations as a Service component ofthe Assistant Secretary of Defense (HA)'s MHS Innovations Council. Execution of the E7 Objective encompasses the development and sustainmem of enterprise-wide efforts to enhance an agile culture ofinnovations. including I.) creating an innovation exchange for idea generation and document repository: 2.) creation, maintenance. and execution ofthe Innovation Management Process: 3.) identifying and disseminating leading practices: 4.) implementing innovation conversion. transition. and dissemination processes: and 5.) developing an innovations awards program to recognize Air Force Medical Systems (AFMS) innovators AFMS/SGSI requires the experience and expertise ofthe current team in the areas of program management. genetics research, Electronic Medical Record data integration and analysis. and IT subject matter expertise. Kingﬁsher will provide the support services described in the FA8052-l I-F~RV20 Performance Work Statement (PWS) for a period ofsix months. Approximately 3.995.00 hours will be acquired during this six month extension. Delivery ofthis service will occur between 30 Aug IS- 28 Fehl4. The estimated value ofthe acquisition is _ and 3400 appropriations will fund this effort. IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IO U.S.C. 2304(e) (2). as implemented by FAR 6.302-2. Unusual and compelling urgency, V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS 0R NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY 0F AUTHORITY! This extension is proposed to be awarded to Kingﬁsher Systems. Inc.. which currently is the prime contractor on the existing contract and provides highly specialized genetics/genomics and information technology research suppon services to the Air Force. Kingﬁsher Systems is responsible for providing subject matter expens who are responsible for genetic testing studies. genome wide association studies. local. federal and state laws pertaining to human subjects. studies to evaluate integration of genetic testing with environmental and personal health histories and personalized medicine studies as well as identify deﬁciencies and gaps in AFMS infrastructure regarding genomic clinical integration and utilization. Insufﬁcient time exists to get a new vendor at this time Thirty to ninety days are required in order for the vendor to meet all security/facility clearances and also have necessary credentials for entry into the Defense Health Head Quarters facility. Once the personnel are cleared. tw0> three weeks are required for the new personnel to obtain network access. It would take additional four to eight weeks to bring a new staffup to the level ofunderstanding ofthe AFMS. This is a total often (10) weeks delay at best for an effort with a period ofperformanee ofsix months. Any delays in performance or disruption in service could prove devastating to the Air Force mission. u; The contractor‘s specialized staff requires a very unique skill set not typically found in most companies. Genetics Subject Matter Expert (SME) II with a PhD in genetics. expert knowledge in genetics and biological science practices related to implementing SGSI concepts. The Data Analyst IV SME must have extensive experience understanding and working with and manipulating Military Health Systems data. access to national benchmarks and knowledge of commercial and clinical datasets to deliver a high technical level of Systems analysis while incorporating and accommodating the business implications of the application oftechnology to the current and future business environment. The IT subject matter expert requires expert knowledge in IM/IT Systems to design. develop and implement SGSI concepts or requirements into new or existing DoD IM/IT programs. Due to the nature ofthe ongoing operations. a transition to a new contractor for such a shon duration is not feasible It would impact operations and endanger equipment and/or personnel. Training new personnel to perform the application integration and maintenance has historically taken from four to six (6) months under the supervision ofprcviously qualiﬁed technical expens. The majority ofthe six-month performance period would be required to attain a level of proﬁciency equivalent to current support of 5051. This signiﬁcant investment in personnel proﬁciency would have to be repeated if another contractor were to be awarded this extension contract. Accordingly. given the highly specialized nature ofthe contract staff required to execute the Innovations mission. Kingﬁsher Systems. Inc. is the only ﬁrm capable of providing the service described in Section III above in the time available. VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE E An extension ofthe current contract for six months will continue to provide services at its current level without interruption. The Air Force will not he soliciting offers from other companies. The follow-on contract will be solicited using via SPAWAR. GSA. or Open Market and various contractors will be given the opportunity to bid on the contract. Other Actions: N/A Qualifying country Sources: N/A VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE As supported by Market Research. a six (6) month extension to continue services is in the best interest ofthc Government. Pricing was determined to be fair and reasonable at contract award based on adequate price competition amongst GSA schedule holders: however pricing did not take into account pricing for the extension ofservices. The total estimated cost for the extension period is —. Evaluation ofthe cun-ent GSA contract GS-IO -0188T revealed that pricing for the anticipated cost is - less than the published GSA price list and - less than the commercial price client site. All factors considered research suppons the determination that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable. I ﬁnd that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable. VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED Market Research (MR) was conducted via the intemet. searching commercially available sources that provide the same or similar services provided by Kingﬁsher Systems.

Identiﬁcation of the agency and contracting activity (FAR 6.303-2(b)(1)). The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Ofﬁce (AGO). Satellite and information Acquisition Division (SIAD) located in Silver Spring, MD, proposes to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition in support of the NOAA/NESDlS Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Program Ofﬁce. The nature andlor description of the action being approved (FAR 6.303-2ib)(2)). NOAA intends to award a ﬁrm ﬁxed price contract to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) for JPSS satellite data products support. . A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (Including the estimated value) (FAR 6.303-1(b)(3)). The requirement is to provide acquisition of data lrom the JPSS satellites, data product generation and distribution, user readiness activities, and scientiﬁc application of these data in the high latitudes at a total price of $1,329.626. This includes an estimated price of $459,242.00 for the 12~month base period, $436,354.00 for the ﬁrst option period, and $434,030.00 for the second option period. This will allow the NOAA/NESDIS JPSS Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) program to accomplish its mission of maximizing the beneﬁts and performance of JPSS data, algorithms, and products for downstream operational and research usersr An identiﬁcation of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition (FAR 6.303-2(b)(4))i The statutory authority permitting other than lull and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled. Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agenm/ Requirements. A statement demonstrating the unique qualiﬁcations of the proposed contractor or the nature of the action requiring the use of the authority (FAR 6.303-2ib)(5)). The University of Alaska Fairbanks is uniquely qualiﬁed to provide these services to the JPSS Program Office. In order to meet data processing time requirements, the data processing and related services must be performed In the Arctic and/or Alaska region. UAF. through the Geographic information Network of Alaska (GINA). is the only source of satellite-based data products for the Arctic and the Alaska region. The success of UAF/GINA was demonstrated in Its contribution to getting NCAA-20 data products to forecasters approximately 90 days after launch of the satellite UAF has unique knowledge and experience acquiring, processing. and dlstributing polar—orbiting satellite data in Alaska. UAF has been doing these successfully for the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (s-NPP) since its launch in 2011 and for NCAA-20 since its launch in 2017. UAF also acquired data from The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) satellites for processing and distribution. No other entity is known to have the ability to acquire, process, and distribute the required data in the timeframes required. UAF possesses infrastructure already in place to be leveraged to support his work. UAF/GINA maintains its own antennas on campus to downlink JPSS data. This infrastructure ls capable of acquiring JPSS's Radio Frequency (RF) X-band downlink as the satellites pass over the antennas up to 14 times per day per satellite. UAF/GINA is the only organization in Alaska besides NESDIS with their own X-band direct readout capabilities. UAFIGINA maintains a high-speed. dedicated leased line between NESDIS Fairbanks Command and Data Acquisition Station (FCDAS) and the UAF campus. GINA maintains computer 8. systems capable of generating and distributing multiple terabytes of satellite data per day. The National Weather Service (NWS) Alaska regional ofﬁce systems are already conﬁgured to obtain satellite data from GINA and display the data on forecaster work stations such as the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System II (AWIPS-II) or ArcGIS. With this infrastructure and experience, UAF reliably and routinely provides near real—time JPSS data to NWS, Alaska Fire Service, and other users. They have technical expertise in keeping the systems running and can quickly resolve any issues as they arise without the relying on external stafﬁng. They are the only source capable of this service in Alaska. UAF has unique experience working with NWS forecasters and other environmental agencies in Alaska. They maintain an excellent working network of relationships with federal, state, local, and research agencies and groups in Alaska that will immediately enable efﬁcient and effective promotion of the use of JPSS data products thus requiring no transition or ramp-up timefrarne. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR 5.2 and. if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies (FAR 6.303-2(b)(6)). As a member of a very small community of polar-orbiting satellite owners, the JPSS Program Ofﬁce is familiar with all entities capable of providing data acquisition, processing, and distribution services for polar- orbiting satellites in the required Arctic and Alaska region. Any entity would be required to have its own infrastructure already in place, and must maintain its own antennas to download JPSS data. The entity must be capable of acquiring JPSS's‘ RF X—band downlink as the satellites pass over the antennas up to 14 times per day per satellite. Because the JPSS Program Office is already intimately familiar with the capabilities of satellite data- processing entities in the Arctic and Alaska, it was not necessary to publish a sources sought notice, which would delay the procurement process without adding value. The JPSS Program Ofﬁce and SIAD has published a notice as required by FAR 5.2 on FedElizOpps on August 30. 2018. This notice provided the Government's intent to negotiate a sole source contract with UAF for this requirement. No responses have been received to date in response to this notice, Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable (FAR 6.303.2(b)(7)). The anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on comparison with historical pricing paid by NOAA to both UAF and other universities for similar satellite data services, as well as other than certified cost or pricing data. Prior to award of the proposed contract, other than certiﬁed cost or pricing data shall be obtained from UAF and a cost and price analysis will be performed and documented to sufﬁciently determine that me cost to the Government of the proposed acquisition will be fair and reasonable. A description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted (FAR 6.303-2(b)(8)). Market research was conducted by the JPSS Program Ofﬁce and AGO/SIAD to identify available sources and to evaluate the availability of the marketplace to meet the requirement. The Contracting Ofﬁcer searched GSA MUItiple Award Schedules for entities capable of processing polar—orbiting satellite data in the required geographical locations. No entities already had the infrastructure available to download, process, and distribute this data. The Contracting Officer reviewed Commercewide vehicles, as well as NASA SEWP V, which do not have satellite data processing as part of their scope. The Contracting Ofﬁcer conducted Internet searches for satellite data processing in Alaska and the Arctic, with no results found except for UAF. Based on the results of market research, the government determined that UAF is the only source capable of performing the required services.

Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition (FAR S.303-2(b)i9)). This contract is necessary to avoid a break in service for this critical mission requirement UAFIGINA possesses the unique capaohities and infrastructure (e.g.. antennas. networks, computer systems) required to perform this requirement An open competition to complete the work would cause intolerable delay to the .IPSS PGRR program, because any new contractor would require signiﬁcant time to acquire the real estate and construct Its own infrastructure in order to meet requirements. Those delays and increase oasis would prose an unacceptable cost and performance risk to the Government. and a full and open competition is not anticipated to result in competitive proposals or any other benefit that would affect these risks Similarly. the geographic location of the requirement cannot be modiﬁed to increase competition because It would result In unacceptable delays in the time required for data acquisition and distribution. 10. A listing of any sources um expressed a written interest in the acquisition (FAR 6,303-2(b)(10)). A synopsis was issued on FedBizOpps on August 30, 2013. requesting that parties express their interest in writing to the Contracting Ofﬁcer.

Identiﬁcation of the Requiring and Contracting Activity, a, Requesting Activity: Defense Security Service (DSS) DITMAC 1550 Crystal Drive Arlington VA 22022 b. Contracting Activity: Defense Security Service Office of Acquisitions 27130 Telegraph Road Quantico, VA 22314 2. Nature and description of action being approved. This Limited Sources Justiﬁcation authorizes the use of other than full and open competition procedures to fulﬁll a current requirement, absent competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A) which states that an urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays. The purpose of this action is to increase the level of effort for contract HSOO21- 18-F-0004 by ten (10) Senior Insider Threat (InT) Analysts from seven (7) to seventeen (17) for a total increase of for the remainder of the base year and option year one (1) to support Defense Security Service (DSS) at Defense Insider Threat Management and Analysis Center (DITMAC) in Arlington, Virginia. This increases the total number of full time equivalents (FTEs) on contract from 12 to 22. The strategy for this effort is to modify the existing contract for the remainder of the base period (through 20 May 2019) and option year one (1) period of performance from 21 May 2019 through 20 May 2020. The contracting office will not exercise option years two (2), three (3), or four (4) on the current contract but will begin eProcurement of these services immediately due to the signiﬁcant increase in scope and changes in the requirement 3. Description of supplies or services required to meet the Agency’s needs In December 2014, the DSS was appointed by the Secretary of Defense to incubate the DITMAC program, afﬁrmed in January 2017 via DoD Directive $205.16, Change 1. The mission of the DITMAC is to enable information sharing, collaboration, analysis, and risk mitigation across the DoD Components to address current and emerging threats to DOD personnel, assets, and information by insiders. It fills a critical gap Within the DoD by empowering and entrusting a single senior Defense ofﬁcial with the task of working with all DoD Component InT programs to promote best practices, drive innovation, promulgate a fundamental set of standards, and provide resource and policy advocacy to senior decision makers, and through an enterprise-level analytic function, close seams between Components that are potentially exploitable by insiders. The National InT Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch InT Programs require agency heads to establish an integrated capability to monitor and audit information for InT detection and mitigation that leverages counterintelligence, security, cybersecurity, human resources, law enforcement and other relevant functions and resources to identify and counter the InT. Under this contract the DITMAC provides an enterprise-level capability for InT information management ﬂiat has the ability to assess risk, refer recommendations for action, synchronize responses, and oversees resolutions of identiﬁed issues. The DSS contract to provide Into Analyst, Unauthorized Disclosure (UD) Analyst, and Enterprise Program Management Ofﬁce (EMPO) Analyst support to the DITMAC was awarded on 03 May 2018 for a total value of $7,957,284.40. Period of performance for the base year began on 21 May 2018. This contract was awarded for one (1) base year and four (4) option years to end on 20 May 2023. At time of award the contract had four (4) Senior InT Analysts, three (3) Senior UD Analysts, one (1) EPMO Senior Program Analyst, and one (1) EPMO Program Analyst for a total of 9 FTE’s on this task order. On 11 September 2018 the Acquisition Ofﬁce received a request to increase the level of effort on the contract by three (3) Senior InT Analysts (from four (4) to seven (7) Senior InT Analysts) for a total of 12 FTE’s on the contract. The Contracting Officer approved the request based on DITMAC documenting that the InT mission had been continuously evolving since its inception at DSS and as a result the amount of ﬂexibility and redirection in tasking has been necessary to effectively support the critical requirements of the DITMAC. In addition, the Contracting Ofﬁcer signed a determination on 27 September 2018 that stated the additional work was within scope of the current contract. As a result of the approved D&F, POOOOI to the subject contract was bilaterally signed on 30 September 2018. This modiﬁcation added the previously mentioned three (3) Senior InT Analysts and increased the contract by $2,365,115.76 from $7,957,284r40 to $10,322,400.16. Currently, DSS DITMAC has an immediate and urgent need of an additional 10 FTE’s for Senior Insider Threat Analysts to reduce risk to the Department of Defense (DOD) and greater DoD Insider Threat security by 1) addressing immediate unforeseen mission increase and 2) provide support to this new normal case reporting volume which is signiﬁcantly more than current processing capability. Each Senior Insider Threat Analyst must be technically qualiﬁed against 10 insider threat speciﬁc tasks. This modiﬁcation will include the remainder of the base period of performance of two (2) months, and the ﬁrst one-year option period for an estimated cost increase of to the award amount. The current award (HSOOZl-lS-F-0004) expires 20 May 2023 and D88 will not exercise option years two (2), three (3), and four (4) but will re-compete this growing requirement. All equipment, supplies, and maintenance shall be included to support this contract. The cost of the increase has been added to the base and ﬁrst option period only and has not been added to the out-years beyond option year one, which expires in May 2021. 4. Identiﬁcation of the justiﬁcation rationale Per FAR Part 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), the work required will fulﬁll an urgent and compelling need utilizing the existing contract (HSOOZl-l 8-F-0004) and any unacceptable delays in fulﬁlling the DITMAC’s requirement for 10 FTE could be a severe detriment to DITMAC’s missionr Per Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USDI) direction and the Ofﬁce of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (0USD(I)) leadership the level and maturing of insider threat capabilities across the Department has signiﬁcantly increased resulting in a dramatic increase in mission. There are no government personnel or billets to complete this mission, contract personnel are the only viable mechanism available to support this need. The DITMAC as the Hub for the DoD continues to see an increase in reporting as new Hubs come on line and Department- wide insider threat processes mature. There are currently 43 components that are each developing their own standard for reporting as directed by the USDI. Once these components develop their own reporting Hubs, then those Hubs are required per USDI guidance to send their reports to the DITMAC. As the Hubs evolve their processes and reporting, the DITMAC is starting to see an increase in caseload, In addition to the number of Hubs that are reporting, ﬂ1e scope of individuals getting reports have also increased. Individual reports have expanded beyond those who have or have not had clearances. Since Jan 2017, DITMAC has received a total o submissions (reports and RFIs) from—DOD Component hubs. For comparison purposes, in Q1 FY17 DITMAC receive .reports total, in Q1 FY18 DITMAC received.and in Q1 FY19 DITMAC received.reports. This is the new normal reporting volume which is signiﬁcantly more than current processing capability. At the time of initial PWS development (2016) the DITMAC had just achieved Initial Operating Capability (IOC). The majority of Component Hubs were not reporting case information and DITMAC was not receiving continuous evaluation results as it is now. In addition, information for the insider threat enterprise which is expected to dramatically increase reporting across the enterprise over this FY. Consequently, there was no baseline at the time of award to foresee the curren increase in reporting to the DITMAC. Immediate impacts to not fulﬁlling the additional resources and reducing the backlog of reports could be detrimental to the DITMAC’S ability to not only track, but hamper the ability to mitigate potential insider threats Examples of impact could result in a potential loss of physical resources to include people, classiﬁed and/0r controlled unclassiﬁed information, potential work place violence (death/physical injury/loss of Government equipment), suicide, unauthorized disclosure of information, and espionage. Since Dependable Global Solutions, Inc. (DGS) has been performing these tasks, DGS is the only contractor that can rapidly recruit and on-board the number of personnel, and infuse them into the operation without any signiﬁcant ramp up time. Re- soliciting the requirement and awarding a new contract would take at a minimum 6—12 months plus the time it would take to transition-in a new contractor, which is not feasible for this requirement at this time. Impact Statement: Delaying hiring of additional analysts as ‘we re-compete the solicitation currently could have serious mission implications. Although another contractor could possibly perform these services, a transition of 30/60 days, as well as a 6 to 12 month acquisition timeline, would cause immediate mission failure. The current national security threats active within the US requires action and mitigation. Without increasing the level of effort on this current task order, the cost and risk to the Govemment increases daily‘ The current contractor’s performance has been deemed excellent by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). 5. Determination of Best Value. It is anticipated the pricing will be fair and reasonable, as previously determined under the terms and since the scope of the existing tasks on this contract has not changed. The anticipated cost to the Government for this task order action will be fair and reasonable. The basis for this determination will include a comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), a detailed price analysis in comparison to price proposed on the original order, and a technical evaluation conducted by the designated Contracting Ofﬁcer‘s Representative (COR). 6. Any Other Supporting Facts. The current security services that are being completed within DITMAC will be severely degraded without the provided support and resources that are needed to continue the critical processes. This would result in undue harm to the DSS, DSS’ classiﬁed information and the mission DSS supports. The DITMAC saw an exponential increase in reporting as each of the Hub’s reporting processes have developed. The DITMAC had no baseline to estimate the volume of reports that would need mitigation at the start of the requirement planning process. Given that information and the updates to the reporting processes, the Government now has more concrete knowledge that can be used in future acquisition planning to include a future ﬂexible contract vehicle that can handle any surge to insider threat reporting and growth within the DoD reporting components. 7. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition. This limited source contract action is a short-term solution. This could not be competed due to the degradation of security and increased risk to DITMAC’s mission. The solution of a limited some contract action for the remaining of the base year and option year one (1) answers the immediate need to reduce risk to the Department and mission security, providing time to compete the same tasks as a new effort. A new effort will take approximately 6-12 months to solicit and award a new contract and provide sufﬁcient time to get a new contractor transitioned-in on mission requirements. This is based on the Agency's Procurement Acquisition Lead Times (PALT) timelines and previous acquisitions of similar size and scope. The customer has been advised that no more increase in personnel changes may happen on this contract. By only exercising option year ( 1) of the current contract, the Government will be given the time it needs to re-compene a new requirement. The new solicitation will utilize a more ﬂexible contract vehicle that is appropriate to the growing DITMAC mission and ﬂuctuating reporting requirements of the Department components. The Government will begin recompeting these services immediately."}

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR SOLE SOURCE BASED ON CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION Competition is not feasible because Altair Engineering is the sole developer of the HyperWorks software package, including several unique FEA features not found in any other model analysis software. Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) personnel have identiﬁed the following unique combination of features that have been integrated into the HyperWorks soﬁware suite: i. NSWCCD-evaluated and proven geometry repair capability for geometry imports in HyperMesli, ii. NSWCCD-evaluated and proven ease of high quality FEA models in shorter time in HyperMesh, iii. NSWCCD-evaluated and proven mesh»to—geometry conversion in HyperMesh, iv. Unique capability to perfom't automated-remeshing of imported shell element models in HyperMesh, vi Unique 1D/2D/3D real—time mesh morphing capabilities using HyperMesh/HyperMorph, vi. Built~in topology/shapdsize optimization in OptiStruct solver, and vii. Built-in stochastic/design of experiment/optimization study software in HyperStudy which can integrate other unique built-in features such as mesh morphing and topology/shape/size optimization. viii. Unique native EXODUS mode] format in development for use with Navy’s CREATE solvers Impact of not completing the HyperWorks procurement on time would mean NSWCCD would lose the aforementioned unique combination of features, and would cause schedule delays to NSWCCD's finite element analysis activities for a number of critical programs including the Virginia Class Submarine, the Columbia Class Submarine, etci 3r MARIGST SURVEY There are no authorized resellers of these Altair Engineering products 4. ADDITIONAL FACTS An alternative cost product analysis was not conducted for this soﬁware, Possible alternative soﬂware packages either do not have the same capabilities or the capabilities are extremely limited. For this reason, there is no product (or combination of products) that is available for an equivalent cost comparison 5.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SUPPLIES/SERVICES, ESTIMATED VALUE, AND DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS NSWCCD Code 86 requests the purchase of the Mathworks Matlab annual software maintenance and support service and new licenses. NSWCCD has used Matlab for over 20 years in the design and development of maneuvering simulation soﬁware and tactical ship control soﬁware for Navy submarines. The annual software maintenance service and new licenses must be purchased to meet the project schedules and renewed by April 30, 2019 with a new period of performance ending 4/30/2020. The estimated price for this procurement is 5 and was determined based on a quote from Lyme Computer Systems. SUPPORTNG DOCUMENTATION FOR SOLE SOURCE BASED ON CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION MathWorks products such as MATLAB software contain a high-level technical computing language and interactive environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numeric computation The MATLAB software provides unique capabilities in a wide range of applications, including signal and image processing, communications, control design, test and measurement, modeling, and data analysis. Additional MATLAB soﬂware components (toolboxes) are available separately and provide specialized ﬁmctions. Examples include the Controls Toolbox, which provides specialized functions for the design and analysis of feedback control systems that are key to NSWCCD Code 86's development of tactical submarine ship control systems, and the Signal Processing Toolbox, which provides specialized functions for time series data analysis and is alien used in data reduction analysis from simulations and experiments. The support and maintenance of Matlab licenses is necessary to insure the current simulation and modeling tools are available to satisfy mission analysis requirements. There is no other soﬁware compatible with Matlab. There are other data visualization and analysis software on the market; however, the use of any other soﬁware would require redesign and redevelopment of all the control system design, algorithm, analysis tools, etc. developed with Matlab. It would cost NSWC over St to re-train over 30 users, over $ for new application licenses, and over 25 to re-develop and migrate the existing designs and algorithms. Acquisition and implementation of an allemativc set of soﬁware tools would not be cost effective and feasible. NSWCCD Code 86 already has perpetual licenses for Matlab and is only paying the support and maintenance services. No other company can provide the soﬁware license and maintenance renewal due to proprietary rights. MARKET SURVEY A search for other data development, data analysis, and numeric computation soﬁware packages with the necessary features was done in technical literature, by web search, and in consultation with scientists and engineers in Code 86. No other soﬁware package having the same ﬂinctionality as Matlab is available. 4. ADDITIONAL FACTS Matlab soﬂware support and maintenance is available from various authorized resellers. 5.

{"id":"4d3401d3-b610-42aa-8350-ebd529327fd2","extracted_text":"Signed_LSJ_ENS_4-8-19.pdf: Limited Sources Justiﬁcation and Approval Administrative Customer Services Division Contract Title: Employee Notiﬁcation System Contractor: Everbridge, Inc. Period of Performance: February 2019 ~ January 2024 Place of Performance: US. Census Bureau, Suitland, MD COR: Rose Cooper Contract Type: Firm Fixed Price 1. Organization/Agency US. Census Bureau (USCB), Acquisition Division 2. Description of Action being approved: The US. Census Bureau seeks to acquire a new ﬁrm ﬁxed price task order for a combined Decennial and Non-Decennial Employee Notiﬁcation System (ENS) from Everbridge Inc for a base period and 3 option years with an estimated total value of $3.6M. Period of Performance is from February 15th, 2019 thru February 14th 2020. 3. Description of Product, Supplies or Services required to meet the Agency‘s needs: The Census Bureau has a requirement to continue the services of Everbridge via new award. Everbridge currently provides a comprehensive employee notiﬁcation system (ENS) for non- decenriial operations. Currently the notiﬁcation system in place enables the Census Bureau to contact all staff, or selected staff across Headquarters (HQ), the National Processing Center (NFC), and six Regional Ofﬁces (ROS) for life safety emergency communication. The Decennial Period (2019-2021) extends this requirement to six Regional Census Centers (RCC), 250 Area Census Ofﬁces (ACO) and numerous enumeration staff quickly during emergencies and non- emergencies. System administrators are located at HQ, NPC, ROS and RCCs. The Census Bureau requires that HQ, each R0, RCC and NFC have the ability to send notiﬁcations to all personnel, or to preset or ﬂexibly selected subsets of personnel. The Census Bureau’s Headquarters includes approximately 6,000 federal employees in Suitland, Maryland. Census’ National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana includes about 2,500 employees during normal operating periods, including employees based at telephone centers located in Tucson, Arizona, and in Jeffersonville, Indiana The agency’s six ROS located throughout the United States account for more than 9,500 management, administrative, and mobile ﬁeld staff, who carry out the bureau‘s data collection activities. Total requirement for Census Headquarters ENS is 18,000 licenses. During Decennial Operations, the six RCCs serve as home-base for 250 ACOs. RCCs and ACOS will potentially employ 250,000 to 500,000 ﬁeld employees whose duty stations are their homes. Limited Sources Justiﬁcation and Approval Administrative Customer Services Division These Field employees are generally alone and are required to canvas large territories on foot, by car, and by other means of transportation. Decennial operations “ramp up” will cause sharp hiring inﬂuxes in ﬁscal years 2019-2021. Operations will begin to wind down formulate ﬁscal year 2020 to ﬁscal year 2022. Estimated employee (license) levels will scale up prior to decennial operations and then reduce following operations. Year ~a] Stafﬁn to 2019-2020 140,000-200,000 2020 500,000 2021 70,000—200,000 2022-2023 Varied There are two database systems from which the current Everbridge ENS uploads personnel and employee emergency contact information, and for which the IT infrastructure are in place. Census Human Resources Information System (CHRIS) and Decennial Applicant, Personnel, and Payroll System (DAPPS -Decennial ONLY). The ENS must have the capacity to interface with both CHRIS and DAPPS and communicate emergency messaging to all HQ, ROs, NPC, telephone staff, RCCs and ACOs simultaneously, as required and necessary for life safety emergency communication. In addition, in accordance with Commerce lT Requirement 024, the ENS vendor must be FedRAMP certiﬁed. 4. The Authority and Supporting Rational and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualiﬁcations to provide the required supply or service: This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule via FAR 8.405-6(c)(1). This is a Limited Source Justiﬁcation. This action is taken pursuant to the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(l)(i)(B). Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized Identiﬁcation of the Justiﬁcation Rationale: The Employee Notiﬁcation System is a critical requirement of the Census Bureau’s mission. The Census Bureau has a current contract that it uses to send emergency messages, conduct well- being checks, and share critical information with approximately 16,000 employees nation-wide. Census ENS system administrators manage Census emergencies by controlling system access, training staff, granted messaging rights, maintaining a continuing ENS education program for employees/users, and conducting periodic tests, as well as coordinating all ENS messaging activities. Census system administrators work closely with Census IT managers and staff to conﬁgure a wide variety of targeted message groups, develop and update information interfaces, monitor daily contact data reﬁeshes, and troubleshoot identiﬁed or potential problems in the accurate transmission of data from Census sources to the ENS vendor system. Limited Sources Justiﬁcation and Approval Administrative Customer Services Division As described elsewhere in this proposal, we estimate Census’ basic intemal costs for operating the current COTS ENS at $75K annually, along with an estimated 1 FTE of staff required to operate manage ongoing system operations. FY 2019 brings the ﬁrst mass inﬂux of tens of thousands of additional, temporary Census employees to manage Decennial annual population counts. Census must maintain and expand its existing ENS capability, without any break in service, for emergency communications to over 250,000 ﬁeld staff, enumerators, and listers located throughout the United States, or life and safety will be severely compromised. Liabilities for Census should we be unable to notify decennial workers of IT System outages, public relations/employee morale issues and/or life- threatening hazards such as ﬂooding, wildﬁres, cyclones, civil unrest and terrorist attacks would place substantial liabilities on the US. Census Bureau. The agency risks Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) violations, employee fatalities, injuries, hospitalizations, exponential workers’ compensation costs, loss of productivity, and ultimately leading to the potential failure of the 2020 Decennial which is a mandated Constitutional requirement. Funding of decennial ENS services ﬁrst became available in the current ﬁscal year, and Census must be able conﬁgure, train, test and stand up a decennial ENS in early calendar 2019 to be prepared for massive staff increases. Awarding the decennial acquisition to a vendor, other than Everbn'dge, funher increases the agency’s liability. The Health and Safety Branch and Application Development and Services Division (ADSD) do not have the staff resources to . maintain and service two systems from two different vendors. The operation of two, parallel ENS systems places an additional burden of stafﬁng and an estimated additional costs of $322K on the Census Bureau to put the required resources in place. Additional staff resources would have to be funded, recniited, and trained to operate such a configuration which in of itself would likely create delays in implementation of decennial ENS operations. As mentioned earlier, there are two database systems from which the current Everbridge ENS uploads personnel and employee emergency contact information, and for which the IT infrastructure are in place. Interfacing with a new vendor will force the ADSD to require security documentation to be rewritten and a new interface developed, Development of an Interface Security Agreement (ISA) and Authority to Operate (ATO) would cost up to $50K based on past 018 and decennial IT experience. The Decennial Census constitutes the largest civilian mobilization in the federal government. The criticality of the results from the Decemtial Census and its translation and usage to government function makes the Census Operation one of the most highly visible functions in the govemment A failure either to protect Decennial employees or to manage Census costs, risks the public reputations of the US. Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW The current system, interface, and security already in place are customized to function with Everbridge. The process of that customization is explained below: 1) Files are transferred via SFTP using keys provided by Everbridge as authentication. Limited Sources Justiﬁcation and Approval Administrative Customer Services Division 2) All data in the system is replaced by the newly uploaded ﬁles. 3) The system allows separating contacts into organizations, one per ﬁle. HQ, NPC, and each regional ofﬁce are separated from one another. 4) The system allows employees to have any number of groups and up to (9) custom ﬁelds and values deﬁned. (You can use the mappings on the ISA which states what we use each ﬁeld for currently) Groups and ﬁelds are custom and user-deﬁned 5) Notiﬁcations can be sent to organizations, they may use any number of selectable criteria based on groups, custom ﬁeld values, and may use addresses/locations on a map to select individuals in the notiﬁcation list, etc. 6) The system shows uploaded ﬁles, the status of the ﬁle loading in the system, and any and all detailed error messages pertaining to the ﬁle itself being processed or any individual records' errors. 7) The system proceeds loading records even when records have errors The error records are skipped and error messages are detailed on the ﬁle upload status page. 8) The current system is and must be delivered as a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform with all maintenance and upgrades being provided by the vendor during the term of the system. 9) 8335 offering must be completely redundant at all levels with no single point of failure. Supporting diagrams and descriptions of redundant elements should be supplied as part of proposal. 10) The system must have built in redundancy to mitigate not having fail-over to another system; 11) The system must be available 24/7, 365 days, and be able to communicate with all Census Bureau staff or selected staff across all facilities quickly during emergencies; EVERBRIDGE HAS PROVIDED ON-SITE DATABASE CUSTOMIZATION AND INSTRUCTION FOR CENSUS IT SPECIALISTS Procuring a new vendor this close to decennial would lead the government to incurring unnecessary and undue costs. Speciﬁcally interfacing with a new vendor will force the Application Development and Services Division (ADSD) to require security documentation to be rewritten and a new interface developed. An additional $250K cost to conﬁgure a new Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) ENS places further ﬁnancial burden on ADSD. Development of an Interface Security Agreement (ISA) and Authority to Operate (ATO) would cost up to $50K based on past 015 and decennial IT experience. Lastly, The Health and Safely Branch (HSB) costs for collaborations with 018, Decennial IT and ADSD to ATO operationalize new COTS ENS is estimated at $75K Limited Sources Justiﬁcation and Approval Administrative Customer Service: Division THE COST OF RETRAINING AND OR TRAINING ON A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM PLACES A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE AGENCY Procuring another ENS vendor places an increased burden on the Census Bureau. The cost of re- training all 6 Regional Ofﬁces and 6 Regional Census Centers adds an estimated $600K to the cost of the acquisition. Additional resources to manage, maintain, operate a new ENS, or potentially two different vendors, should a different vendor be used for Decennial Operations, would require the Health and Safety Branch to hire additional staff. This places an additional burden on the Census Bureau of an estimated_$322]( per life of the contract. The total additional ﬁnancial burden to the Agency for switching ENS platforms is an estimatEd $1.2M. EVERBRIDGE HAS RECEIVED FEDRAMP AUTHORITY TO OPERATE; PACKAGE ID F1212165928 In order for a cloud based notiﬁcation system to operate interchangeably with Census based Information Technology Infrastructure and be awarded an Interface Security Agreement, a FedRAMP certiﬁcation must be achieved. Everbridgc has in fact received its FedRAMP certiﬁcation (ID F1212165928) and has completed the Interface Security Agreement (ISA) for the interface and data exchanged between the Census Human Resource Information System (CHRIS) Emergency Notiﬁcation System (ENS) and Evcrbridge. System security controls have been documented and tested in accordance with current Census Bureau IT Security Program Policy. Everbridge has met the requirement with the IT Security Ofﬁce (ITAO to assess the need for and if necessary to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). The process for acquiring an ATO and Interface Security Agreement with a new vendor takes on average six months. Procuring a new source places and extraordinary time burden on the agency as well as prohibiting the ability to communicate emergency notiﬁcations to employees/contractors. Excluding the time line to test and certify a secure interface with Census IT Systems, In the event this requirement was to be competed and given to a new awardee, the time to solicit, evaluate and issue a new award alone would take us at least 2 months past the needed ramp up date of March 2019 leaving thousands of Census Employees out in the ﬁeld without any form of Emergency Notiﬁcation Service. In addition to the 2 months past March 2019, there then would be up to an additional six months to receive ATO and 18A with the new vendor, which would put thousands of Census employees at risk without any form of Emergency Notiﬁcation Services for up to 8 months in total. The requirements for Certiﬁcation and Accreditation (C&A) that meets all current Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) at the moderate level are noted below: Document Name Applicable Guidance System Security Plan NlST SP800—18 Risk Assessment NIST SP800-30 Contingency Plan NIST SP800-34 Security Control Assessment Plan NIST SP800-53a Limited Sources Justiﬁcation and Approval Administrative Customer Services Division Security Control Assessment Test Cases and Results NIST SP800-53a Continuous Monitoring Plan NIST SP800-37, SP800-53, & SP800-53a Security Assessment Plan NIST SP800-37 NIST Special Publication referenced above are available from: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html 5. Best Value Determination: In accordance with FAR 8.404(d) the contracting ofﬁcer will determine that the ﬁnal contract price is fair and reasonable. A comparative analysis will be performed between the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), historical prices paid and the oﬁ‘eror’s proposal in the determination of fair and reasonableness. In addition, prices offered will be compared against the schedule holder GSA listed prices. 6. Market Research conducted The Health and Safety Branch (HSB), ACSD, conducted extensive online research. A speciﬁc search for “Employee Notiﬁcation Systems” resulted in three additional potential providers: Atl-loc by Blackberry, Motorola Solutions, and Alertus. Because the federal IT requirement for integrated services/systems requires FedRAMP certiﬁcation at the time of award, HSB also conducted a thorough search of certiﬁed providers on FedRAMPgovi Only BlackBerry and Everbridge were found to be FedRAMP certified during market research. Both Everbridge and Blackberry provide comprehensive, multiple-location, mass communication services through redundant means of communication. This includes text messaging, email, work and cell phones. Both services allow central command to target personnel by geographic location and run communication veriﬁcation reports. Finally, both products permit end-users to edit/update their personal contact information. However, since the Blackberry ADHOC soﬁware program has not been procured and tested here at the Census, they would still need to go through the function and security vetting process to obtain and Interface Security Agreement while establishing an ATO. 7. Statement of actions, if any to remove barriers to competition in the future. The current contract was previously competed and awarded in 2014‘ Going forward aﬁer decennial operations have concluded, the Census Bureau intends on competing the follow on requirement amongst additional Employee Notiﬁcation vendors who are FedRAMP certiﬁed and offer 24/7-hour customer support operations based on future market research. 8. Any other facts supporting justiﬁcation: In addition to an excess transition cost of $1 .SM, switching providers at this time would require a new interface and security documentation development (with CHRIS and DAPPS systems), testing, and operator and staff training (HQ, NPC, Telephone centers, 6 ROS and 6 RCCs and 250 ACOs). Acquiring a new vendor creates a six-month time constraint on ENS operability. Limited Sources Justiﬁcation and Approval Administrative Customer Services Division This delay will impact Decennial operations that start in 2019 in that any emergency messaging needed during the time constraint will not be delivered. This delay places thousands of Decennial employees at great risk for injury and increases liability for the Agency The adverse impact on the Census Bureau of NOT procuring Everbridge as a sole provider for the Emergency Notiﬁcation System has ominous, cascading consequences for the life safety of all Census employees and contractors; Census CHRlS and DAAPS systems; multiple divisions: Field, ADSD, IT, Decennial, and ACSD; an overwhelming time and ﬁnancial burden; increased liability for the Agency; and a severe risk to the Census Bureau’s mission. 9.

The following documentation has been prepared in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(c)(2)t 1. Identiﬁcation of the agency and the contracting activity, and speciﬁc identiﬁcation of the document as a “Limited-Sources Justiﬁcation\": This is a Limited Sources Justiﬁcation (LSJ) issued on an Urgent and Compelling basis in accordance with FAR Part 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A). The client is General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), National Customer Service Center (NCSC) The contracting activity is Region 6 GSA, FAS, Assisted Acquisition Services. 2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: A sole source task order is being established with Leader Communications, Incorporated (LCI) to continue providing Logistical Support services for the NCSC, FAS, GSA. The task order is being established on a ﬁrm-ﬁxed price basis with one three month base period and nine one month option periods. Delays in the performance of a successor contract have created a gap in services. Services must continue, and the government cannot establish an alternative solution on a competitive basis. Therefore, a non-competitive task order is being issued to LCI to continue services. A Request for Quotations (RFQ) was issued on July 17, 2018 and closed on September 7, 2018 for a successor task order. The RFQ was issued to Multiple Award Schedule, Professional Services, Special Item Number 874-7, Integrated Business Program Support Services contract holders. The RFQ was a 100% set—aside for small business holders in NAICS 541611. The competition for the successor task order was conducted on a full and open basis after the exclusion of sources. The successor task order was made on February 15, 2019, but the contractor is not able to begin performance because a stay of performance was issued in response to a GAO protest. The inability of the contractor selected for award to begin performance, combined with the inability of the govermnent to competitively contract for services in an alternative contracting forum, and the inability of the government to allow services to lapse when the incumbent contract expires on March 31, 2019, necessitates a non-competitive short-term task order with the incumbent contractor on on urgent and compelling basis. This task order will be negotiated and awarded fora base period of performance of three months with nine optional months of performance. Performance will begin on April 1, 2019, and all options will expire on March 31, 2020, : 3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value: The total estimated value of the task order is —with all nine optional month periods. The estimated value ofthe base three month period is _ The support contract provides live customer service agent support beginning Sunday at 8pm Central, 24 hours a day through Thursday, and until 8:30pm Central Friday for NCSC. N CSC intends to achieve the following objectives through the contractor-provided support: - Provide continuous live phone and live chat support during operating hours that meet performance requirements for wait time to answer and call resolution 0 Answer emails within tirneii'ames that meet performance requirements 0 Achieve a high level of customer satisfaction in quality of call resolution, conﬂict-resolution, and responsiveness to customer concerns 0 Maintain an expert level of knowledge about GSA programs and methods to resolve problems . o Resolve and research client billing and open account issues within program targets . o Assisting users with the ordering process and any issues associated with GSA Advantage orders, including orders that may not have been fulﬁlled by the vendor: o Assisting users on the use of GSA Advantage, GSA cLibrary, and cBuy applications. o Assisting vendors with accessing Purchase Order (P0) in the [’0 Portal application - Maintenance calls related to building issues 4. The authority and supporting rationale (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i) and (b)(l)) and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor’s unique qualiﬁcations to provide the required supply or service: The authority for the action is found in 48 CFR § 8.405~6 ~ Limiting sources. (A) An urgenl and compelling need exists) andﬂﬂluwing the procedures would resull in unacceplable delays; The services pcrforrrrctl by the NCSC are essential to GSA’S mission and 51% of resources in the NCSC are contractor programmatic support NCSC is the recognized customer service source for clients of the GSA, GSA customers contact the NCSC by phone, mail, email, chat as well as the AskGSA portal when they need information on GSA products and services or have an inquiry on or a complaint regarding an order they have placed through GSA. GSA services and supplies are provided through vendor direct delivery, GSA’s Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Program, and other contract vehicles such as GWAC. The NCSC responds to all telephone calls directed to the programs supported by the NCSC. The NCSC is tasked with responding to worldwide customer requests for service and information ﬂuough a published toll free phone number, one of the maj or customers being the Department oFDefense (DOD). The NCSC provides call center support during the advertised hours of operation. Aﬁer these hours of operation, customers may leave voicemail messages (night line). The Mission of the NCSC is highly critical to other govermnent programs, and the requirement for services to continue without interruption represents an urgent and compelling need. The NCSC mission is to provide exceptional, efﬁcient and reliable customer service by creating a positive experience and delivering best in class solutions through continuous innovation, The vision of the NCSC is to be the global provider of exceptional service, proactive support, and solutions to its customers. The NCSC is a full—service center providing assistance and information to make acquisitions simple and efﬁcient. Services offered include: 0 Entry of New Orders Status and Discrepancy Resolution on Existing Orders Product and Service Information Assistance to Vendors Interested in Multiple Award Schedules Tier 1 Support for Acquisition Management (AM), Acquisition Gateway, Professional Services and Integrated Technology Services (ITC). - Chat Support for Acquisition Management (AM) and Integrated Technology Services (ITC) - Survey Support I Business-line Speciﬁc Reports, Dashboards, and Analytics Currently, the NCSC has Service Level Agreements in place for the following internal customers: Supply, Acquisition Management (AM), Integrated Technology Services (ITC), Professional Services, Acquisition Gateway, and Public Building Services (PBS) vendor support In addition, the NCSC has responsibility for an overseas email box. Through this overseas email box, the NCSC supports Afghanistan and Kuwait deployed troops by providing weekly reports to customers in Afghanistan and Kuwait; assists in expediting high priority orders; provide shipment tracking from the Consolidation and Containerizaiion Point (CCP) to the Consignee (example: From DLA New Cumberland to Afghanistan Supply Support Activity), The NCSC also supports high level customers by providing customer liaisons These NCSC liaisons fill a critical role with ensuring that status of supply orders are researched for these customers who many times are fulﬁlling needs for readiness of troop deployment. Without full resource support in NCSC, fulﬁllment of the overseas email box and the providing of specialized customer liaisons would be in jeopardy along with support of the troops in deployment. The contractor staff makes up 51% of the NCSC resource pool. A reduction of 51% to the current NCSC available resource pool would be catastrophic to all of the NCSC internal customers they service and would have the greatest impact to external customers (DOD, civilian agencies, state and local governments). A reduction of 5 1% in available resources would impact internal GSA clients who rely on the fulﬁllment of their Service Level Agreements with the NCSC to carry out program missions. If the NCSC were unable to meet its commitments to internal GSA clients, the overall quality of GSA- provided services to the federal government would decline. Additionally, the NCSC would be unable to maintain its position as a revenue-generating organization that sustains its operations by providing services to internal clients for a fee. The inability to remain self— sustaining would lead to its organizational collapse, For external customers, support provided to them through order taking, discrepancy resolution and order status research would be severely impacted For example, the NCSC places orders for the State Department that is highly specialized order taking. For FY 18 the NCSC placed 1,210 fax/email orders from customers and 2,981 phone orders. With a reduction of 5 1% to the NCSC resource pool, order placement would not be fulﬁlled with limited resources attempting to work multiple customer service functions currently spread over a fully staffed contractor/govermnent resourced NCSC. Currently over 90 percent of calls and emails received by NCSC are related to the Supply program. The majority of these are in support of DOD operations and critical missions. Failure to have contractor support could result in the inability to support a DOD mission.l With a 51% reduction in staff, the 1 Each year, the Department of Defense (DoD) spends about $350 billion to ﬁrrther the readiness of its forces for current and future military operations, This includes attracting, retaining, educating, and training top quality military personnel; keeping equipment well maintained; and providing the food, Fuel and other material needed to Kuwait operations. DoD broadly deﬁnes readiness as the ability of US. military forces to ﬁght and meet the demands of the National Military Strategy, which describes the armed forces’ role in achieving national security objectives. DaD assesses readiness on at least two levels: Individual units such as Army and Marine Corps balm/ions Navy shin: and/117‘ F urce squadrons and faint forces campaswl at units ﬁ'om more than one service branch. The United States military, the largest customer served by the NCSC, expects itself to always be ready to respond to the orders ofthe President. The requirements of what goes into “being ready” are determined by the senior leaders of each military service based on global commitments and priorities and are validated by Department of Defense policy makers. These requirements ensure that soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines receive necessary training and well-maintained equipment that enables them to succeed no matter the mission. When readiness suffers, the risks to forces increase. To manage readiness, the department must balance the supply and demand of depleyable forces around the world. i i 5 l t l % NCSC would be unable to maintain its current 24 hour operations: which would result in catastrophic program failure, and thereby place forces at increased risk. Units described such as Army/USMC battalions, Navy ships, and AF Squadrons in which mission critical supplies cannot be properly tracked affects unit readiness. The NCSC has managed approximately ”064 expedited requests received from customers via phone and email in 1“ Y i X and the lirst quarter of F Y 19. largely for D01.) customers to support Lhc wartighter, and for mission critical operations. An expedited request is identified as urgent supply rcquircment from a customer often requiring assistance with tracking the shipment or assisting with procurement actions. Approximately ninety (91)) percent ol‘thc NCSC workload is for supply customers to support military “Readiness\". Looking at the data for FY I8, and assuming no contract support {or a period of twelve months, there is a possibility olithe fol lowing: a The twelve (12) month FY18 NCSC historical call volume was 101,058 calls, Ninety percent of the NCSC incoming calls were related to the Global Supply Program. Ninety percent of 101058 is equal 90,952 calls, Ot'thcsc calls, 95% are currently answered by contractors. Without contract support, 86.404 calls (95% of 90,952) would be redirected to government personnel, The resolution ol‘eustomer concerns would be delayed by weeks or months with a 95% reduction in resources to answer and resolve customer calls. As a result, critical orders may not be issued l‘or customeis, mission critical supplies would not be expedited, customers would have to ﬁnd other sources to purchase their materials From. 0 The twelve (12) month email volume was 1125,9111 Ninety percent ofthe email volume was related to the Global Supply Program. All of these emails were handled by contractors. Without contract support, government personnel would he required to respond to these emails, and it is anticipated that the response time for emails will elevate ti'om 48 hours to possibly up to 16 days. C An cxmnple where u loiday response time would be unacceplable is a recent customer inquiry regarding points of contacts for three requisitions pending delivery to the customer. The vendor was holding material in storage until a POC could he provided at the delivery location. Without the NCSC being able to timely research and conﬁrm a customer contact the material would have resulted in storage fees charged to GSA and the customer order would remain untiiltilled. a As another example 01‘ the ciiticality ol'providing a timely rcspousc to clients served by the Global Supply Program, emails have heen sent from theater by the — a Without contract support the NCSC Work In Progress (WIP) would more than double from 4.000 to 8,000 during a 12 month period, It will also cause the response rate to the customers to increase from it days to greater than 16 clays on average. The 16 days is based on historical NCSC data when looking at potential WIP size oi\" 8,000. The NCSC closed 301‘) discrepancies from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 (the ﬁrst quarter (rfl’Y19), which equates to a value ol‘$422.533.l0. l‘his dollar value represents the total Value of customer orders the NC SC researched and either provided the customer eicdit back to reorder or provided proof of delivery of shipment. T110 resolution of discrepancies has resulted in customer agencies recouping funding which can be used For other mission critical items to he purchased. Not being able to render proper support to DoD and other Federal Agencies is unacceptable The lack of capacity by the NCSC to support global customers severely impacts their 'ion and planning readiness for soldiers, sailors, airmen7 marines and DA Civilians. ‘l he N(‘.S(.‘ operating at 49% capacity clearly affects agency’s missions and ultimately has a detrimental impact on the American Public that they serve. As the incumbent, predecessor contractor, LCI is the only contractor with the experience and manpower to fulﬁll the NCSCs ongoing operational requirements during the stay of performance ofthe successor contract. The stay ofpcrtbmnance issued on February 25, 2019, and the incumbent; predecessor lll’A Order expires on March 3 t, 2019. First, the stay of performance prohibits performance by the successor contractor who has been awarded a task order on the basis of a previous competition. Second, the time period between those two dates is 34 days. 'l‘hiny-t‘oui' days is not long enough to compete a short—term task order for the complex nature of the services being performed by contractors embedded in the NCSC organization. The RFQ for the successor task order was open for six weeks, and evaluated and negotiated for four additional months. It there is not a way to competitively solicit services before the end of the predecessor contract, applicable regulations allow the waiver o t'cornpelition. l‘ltirtyefour days is also not long enough to comply with Nondisplaccmcnt of Qualiﬁed Workers clause in the expiring HPA ()rder, (FAR 52. ZZZ—l7, JANUARY 2(Jl 3). The clause requires the predecessor contractor to docunicnt that the successor contractor has given employees oi\" the predecessor contractor cove-red under the McNamara O’Hara Service Contract Act, and who are qualiﬁed for positions with the successor contractor, the right of ﬁrst refusal ot‘ employment offers, 48 CFR § 52222—17, (d)(l) states, The Contractor shall, not less {Iran 30 days before completion 0/1/72 (lonli‘aelnr’r per/brnmnce qf'ml'rices (m the con/rue]. furnish the Contracting ()[fieer with Li certified list ofthe names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. Where changes to the worlgtbrce are made otter the submission of the certiﬁed list described in this paragraph, the Contractor shall. in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, not less than 10 days before completion ofthe services on this contract, ﬁtrnish the Contracting Ojj‘icer with an updated certiﬁed list 0fthc names of all service employees employed within the last month of eantractper/brmance. The updated list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment, and, where applicable, dates of separation of each service employee under the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. The 30-day and 10-day timcframes above are applicable post award, when services are transitioning from contract to the next. Thirty-four days is inadequate to solicit, award, and transition a service contract with the above regulatory constraints, Therefore, the incumbent contractor is the only contractor who can provide the continuity of services necessary for sustained operations and the avoidance of harm to the government from critical mission delays. LCI has had satisfactory performance during the contract period, base and option years, and additionally during the current contract extension with no complaints regarding performance over being reported. LCI has adhered to all terms and conditions of the contract often exceeding expectations. LCl has an active status in SAM and LCI currently does not have any exclusions. PPIRS assessments reviewed for LCl did not reveal any derogatory information Finally, LCI has been found to be compliant with the requirements, and found to be responsible in accordance with FAR 91 04. To prevent a work stoppage of the NCSC, which provides customer service support that is missioncsscntial to the clients’ that they serve, and depends on the support contract for 51% of the work effort needed to serve those clients, it is imperative that a sole source award be made LCI, the incumbent contractor. LCI, is the only contractor having the knowledge, experience and manpower to fulﬁll the NCSC’s operational requirements with no break in continuity between the time of expiration of their current contract and the time the new contract can begin performance Following the normal acquisition procedures would result in unacceptable delays that would cause harm to the government, and prevent the client from being able to meet their mission. 5. Determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d): The level of effort, and labor mix for this order is consistent with the expiring BPA Task order. The proposed prices of the non—competitive task order have been reviewed and determined to be fair and reasonable given the need to continue NCSC contractor support and taking into account the historical price and IGCE, the comparison of the quoted prices in relation to the increased conditions of risk under the Task Ordcrr The ultimate fair and reasonable determination was based on the following considerations: 0 The limited alternatives the government has in fulﬁlling the needs given this vendor’s unique position as the incumbent and the inability of any other contractor to provide services without having to transition in the thirty four days available, including fully train or provide background checks for new staff. 0 Expected increase to price due to the vendor’s agreement to be obligated anywhere between 3 months and 12 months, with the contract becoming essentially month—to—month if it continues beyond the ﬁrst three months. 0 The urgent demand for continued services within an expected reasonable price, given the requirements of the Task Order for moderately complex, embedded contractor services to continue for a short duration of time o The increased risk to the contractor to maintain its staff in a contract with a drastically reduced period of performance and no permanent contractor solution in place a The SCA wage determination impact on price Given that the task order is being issued against an existing Multiple Award Schedule contract, the awarded labor rates have been determined to be fair and reasonable at the schedule level. The overall price of the task order has also been determined to be fair and reasonable by price analysis methods 6. Description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted: Extensive market research was conducted between February 2017 and June 2018 in preparation of the recompetition of services that occurred with the issuance of a Request for Quote to Schedule holders in July, 20l 8. Two Requests for Information were issued to schedule holders during this timeframe. Both schedule and non-schedule sources were sought to provide moderately complex administrative and programmatic support services for a government customer service and call center, focusing primarily on procurement, funding, and logistical customer issues. Previous market research informed the government that the commercial marketplace does not offer services that can be competed among qualiﬁed service providers and transitioned in a timeframe of ﬁve weeks without compromising the quality and timeliness of services The procurement that resulted in stayed performance demonstrates the availability of resources in the market and has produced oat least one Viable alternative. However, the dismantling efforts that would be required to transition to any other provider would severely compromise operations, and create instability in the delivery of services, Reductions and delays in services would have secondary deleterious effects on multiple government programs served by the NCSC. Any other source required to accomplish transitioning efforts would require several weeks of transition to include familiarization, l g l training, and background investigations for any staffing not ﬁlled with personnel retained from predecessor contract. Accmnplishing the transition without sufﬁcient planning and organization significantly places the operational readiness at jeopardy and increased risk and unacceptable harm to the services that the NCSC provides to the military and other key customers 7. Any other facts supporting the justiﬁcation: None. 8. A statement of the actions, it\" any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is matle: The current restriction in competition is a consequence eta delay in performance by the contractor competitively awarded the successor task order. The stay ot’pcrt‘onnance w issued as the ' ult eta GAO protest. Apart from creating a larger potential overlap between an incumbent and successor contract, there is little that may be done to remove barriers posed by a protest As evidenced by the signature below, the technical personnel have certiﬁed that any supporting data contained herein is both accurate and complete.

Agency and Contracting Activity. Identiﬁcation ofthe agency and the contracting activity. and speciﬁc identification ofthe document as a “Justiﬁcation for an Exception to Fair Opportunity.\" The Department ofHomeland Security Ofﬁce of Procurement Operations. (0P0 Division). prepared thisjustiﬁcation for an exception to fair opportunity. 2. Nature and/or description ofthe action being approved. Noblis currently provides support services to DHS 8&1‘ under contract HSHQI)C-l 6-J- 00238. This contract has a current period of performance (POP) that ends July 28, 2019. This action is to extend the POP until September 30, 2019. No additional costs are anticipated as a result ofthis change. 3. A description ot'the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s need (including the estimated value). The scope of the current contract, which will not change under the extension, states, \"SETA support services for TITAN will include support that is ﬂexible innovative, and responsive to the dynamic and evolving needs of DHS 5&T, Instead of providing the traditional “one federal employee, one support contractor\" solution to TlTAN‘s diverse support needs, the contractor shall support coordination across clusters ofactivitics and the DHS S&T Directorate. The overall intent ofthe support is to foster the coordination necessary to provide a robust and integrated set ofservices to address DHS S&T requirements and priorities and engage with the HSIB and the HSE.\" The estimated costs to be incurred during the extension period are $282000. which will be covered by underbum on the current effort. Therefore there is no expected additional net cost to the government. 4. Identify the exception to fair opportunity and supporting rationale, including a demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualiﬁcations or the nature of the acquisition requires use ofthe exception cited. [lfthe contracting officer uses the logical follow-on exception. the rationale shall describe why the relationship between the initial order and the follow-on is logical (e.g.. in terms ofscope, period ofperformance. or value)]. [Select one and explain rationale below]: FAR l6.505(b)(2)(i)(A). The agency need for the supplies or services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would result in Unacceptable delays.

Only one awardee is capable ofproviding the supplies or services required at the level oi‘quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. [Thejustiﬁcation must demonstrate that the proposed contractor‘s unique qualiﬁcations or the nature of the acquisition requires use ot'the exception cited]. FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C). The order must be issue on a sole»source basis in the interest of economy and efﬁciency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. [For logical follow-on, the rationale shall describe why the relationship between the initial order and the follow-on is logical (e.g,, in terms ofscope, period of performance, or value)]: FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(D). It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee. FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(E). For orders exceeding the simpliﬁed acquisition threshold, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from a speciﬁed source. Rationale: _The DHS S&T Ofﬁce of Industry Partnerships (01F) was intending to obtain follow»on support services through the SETA III contract; however due to a protest ofthat contract and a continuing delay on any award, this is no longer an option. ()IP is working on a competitive award ofsupport services outside SETA [II with an expected award in early-mid September 20l9, The extension ofllSliQDC-lé-J-00238 is intended to prevent a lapse in required support services and has a safety margin in case ofany delay in awarding the follow-on support contract. 5. Determination by the contracting ofﬁcer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable 6, Any other facts supporting thejustiﬁcation. 7‘ A statement of the actions, ifany, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the exception to fair opportunity before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made. Since it is highly unlikely that the award ofthe subsequent support services contract will be made by the end ofJuly (at least ﬁve weeks early) no action is anticipated that would allow continuity ofOIP support 8.

Systems within Bldg. 73 are integrated and fully operational with systems in Bldg. 85. Although the software itself is not proprietary, the programming, integration. and design of the security suite is exclusive to Securadyne and service by any other vendor would void the systems currently under warranty until 2020. The proposed vendor has in—depth knowledge of the security suite providing for continuity and rapid response to any issues that arise. The 96 CI' G requires rapid emergency response 24/7 to ensure the critical security suite remains operational. The proposed vendor has the capability to meet response times and the inrdepth knowledge of the integrated security suite to provide rapid onesite emergency services preventing security disruptions and mission stoppage. Procuring an annual maintenance service to ensure the longevity and functionality of the current infuse security system presents the best value to the government versus replacing the system. which is estimated to cost in excess 0 . Not having this vital service would lead to an unacceptable delay and disruption to the mission. Section D: Efforts to Obtain Competition Market research conducted for this acquisition included GSA Advantage and Internet searches. The Government was unable to identify alternative maintenance services for the existing equipment/configuration. Utilizing an alternative vendor would require replacement of the entire system. It was determined by checking product costs that to replace the total system was signiﬁcantly above and beyond the cost to continue with the existing system maintenance vendor. To replace or introduce a new system conﬁguration verses utilizing the original vendor product conﬁguration would present ssues resulting in higher cost to the government and potential delays to mission success due to compatibility/Interoperab among varying systems. Section E: Steps to Preclude Future Single Source or Brand Name Awards The 96 Cl' G will continue monitoring the industry through trade journals. technical symposia, and contact with industry representatives should a future requirement arise. At this time, the proposed vendor is the only authorized vendor, to use an unauthorized vendor would void manufacturer warranty coverage for the existing system and would cost the government substantially for standalone noncompatible systems This solution provides the government the best value and lowest cost. The government continually reviews options to meet safety and security compliance to determine if new technology is more cost effective than the existing in use system. The government also conducts market research to locate vendors who may produce a more cost effective quality solution to meet the government minimum requirements.

'rocuremen Technology Acquisition Center Office of Acquisition Operations Department of Veterans Affairs Real Time Location System, VISN 1 Control Number: TAC-19-51825 JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 1. Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Procurement Acquisition and Logistics Technology Acquisition Center 1701 Directors Blvd Austin, TX 78744 2. Description of Action: The proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price effort for the completion of the installation and testing of the Real Time Location System (RTLS) at three medical centers within Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 1. 3. Description of the Supplies or Services: The proposed action is to procure services, to include incidental hardware, to complete the installation of a Real Time Location System (RTLS), which was initiated under the National RTLS ID/IQ Task Order: VA118A»12~D~0025 VA118A-17»J—0008. During the RTLS Implementation, VA was working on a National Wireless Access Point (AP) replacement project, which impacted three sites within VISN 1: Brockton VAMC, West Roxbury VAMC, and White River Junction VAMC. The AP replacement project consisted of designing and adding/replacing hardware at each of these sites so that the VA installed RTLS Location Grade AP placement. Replacing access point hardware and changes in location of AP hardware impacted the RTLS project, specifically the Wi-Fi Location Accuracy. The timing of the OIT AP replacement project occurred during the Wi-Fi Location Accuracy Fingerprinting task (capturing signal strength of each access point), Much of the RTLS equipment such as readers, tags, software, and servers, were received and much of the installation of RTLS had occurred, such as servers, software, and sensors. The AP replacement project has been completed. and VA requires installation be completed. Three sites within VISN 1, including Brockton VA Medical Center (VAMC), West Roxbury VAMC, and White River Junction VAMC, require the implementation of the RTLS System, providing real time location for locations covered with clinical grade hardware and with Wi-Fi only areas. The Contractor shall continue implementing the VISN 1 procured solution that began but was not completed at the three remaining VAMC and which was designed and agreed upon under the National RTLS Program utilizing the National RTLS Contract. The contractor will need to work directly with Centrak and Intelligent lnsites to complete the installation, The three sites require the contractor to perform tagging equipment per the National tagging standard and commission the asset into the Intelligent lnsites Software. The contractor will need to Fingerprint each facility. Fingerprinting technology captures signal strength from the Wireless access points using multiple RTLS Active Tags Data, which is collected throughout the facility using proprietary Centrak software application The data collected is then used to determine the location of an asset through Centrak‘s proprietary algorithm. The contractor will need to work with Intelligent lnsites to complete configuration of the Intelligent lnsites software, such as create the approved business rules, update location fields to include the AEMS/MERS space file, and ensure Centrak fingerprinting and location data has been integrated into Intelligent lnsites. In addition, after the implementation has been completed. the contractor shall test location Real Time Location System, VISN 1 Control Number: TAG-1961825 accuracy for Wi-Fi and clinical grade locations, test RTLS system functionality, and rovide training to staff at each site. The total estimated price of this proposed action is h and includes a period of performance of 10 months from date of award. 4. Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements,\" 5. Rationale Supportir_19_l_Jse of AuthoritLCited Above: Based on market research, as described in paragraph 8 of thisjustification, it was determined that limited competition is available for this procurement, VA requires any source to use both Intelligent Insites and Centrak as subcontractors for this effort. Under the National RTLS ID/IQ VISN 1 Task Order, approximately 50% of the installation has been completed VA purchased Intelligent Insites and Centrak hardware, software, and services to design and install RTLS for these three sites, and if another RTLS solution was used, these costs would be duplicated . Hardware and multiple software applications are integrated to the core RTLS infrastructure to achieve benefits in locating assets and improving workflow. The use of Intelligent Insites and Centrak is critical in meeting the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a different RTLS solution. Under the previous contract, VA purchased Centrak’s Clinical Grade readers, active asset tags, and location software package, Centrak designed the layout of the readers which were installed, configured in the Centrak software, and validated. Additionally, VA purchased Intelligent Insites RTLS Software and received configuration services such as map rendering, in which Insites modified the floor plans so that end user has a graphical interface to view equipment, and regioning of space in Insites, which creates a location to identify which room the equipment is reporting in. This requires the integration of Centrak location engine with Intelligent Insites software. Furthermore, several Interfaces have been developed between the Intelligent InSites RTLS solution and the Veterans Integrated System Architecture (VISTA). Within the space that Insites regioned in its software, is a field that allows the VISTA AEMS/MERS Interface to update location and last inventory date in AEMS MERS with the location obtained from the RTLS, Because the configuration and integration of Centrak and lnsites requires access to proprietary data, only Centrak and Intelligent Insites are capable of meeting VISN 1's requirement to continue the installation as subcontractors. For example, in Wi-Fi areas, Centrak performs Fingerprinting, which captures signal strength from the wireless access points using multiple RTLS Active tags. Data is collected throughout the facility using proprietary Centrak software application The data collected is then used to determine the location of an asset through Centrak‘s proprietary algorithm. In addition, Centrak certified engineers are required to validate, test, and tune the Centrak infrastructure. The location data obtained from Fingerprinting and from the Centrak hardware is then integrated within Intelligent Insites asset tracking application. Intelligent Insites conﬁguration utilizes proprietary software to process location data streamed from Centrak's location server and to region space on ﬂoor maps. Any source would have to have access to both Intelligent Insites and Centrak proprietary data in order to provide the aforementioned services and ensure proper configuration. Failure to provide these services with Centrak and Intelligent Insites will result in delays and Page 2 of 7 Real Time Location System, VISN 1 Control Number: TAO-1951825 duplicated costs of products and services already procured. Specifically, if VA could not use Intelligent lnsites and Centrak, VA would have to replace all the existing Intelligent lnsites and Centrak brand name items resulting in extensive delivery delays and duplicated costs of over-that would not be recovered through competition. These estimates are based on previous efforts. VA requires a contractor to coordinate efforts with Centrak and Intelligent lnsites to complete the configuration, integration, testing, and training on the RTLS. The contractor will need to work with Centrak and Intelligent lnsites simultaneously as separating the work into two requirements would be inefficient and cause tremendous delays during the testing process. Centrak and intelligent lnsites’ engineers work very closely during the integration. Centrak hardware's unique ID number is entered into the lnsites database. Often, the hardware can be replaced during the setup process as they may fail, which requires an update in the lnsites application. If the two subcontractors are not able to work on this effortjointly, the Intelligent lnsites database would be compromised and result in inaccurate location information. Centrak location information is streamed to the lnsites Connector server and then sent to the lnsites platform server for visibility of the data on the RTLS user application. If the subcontractors are not able to work together during this process, it would cause signiﬁcant delays and technical issues, such as not providing location updates to the end user. This would have a negative impact on patient care, as the care provider’s ability to locate medical equipment, such as infusion pumps or mobile ultrasound, in a timely manner, which will affect the quality of treatment Veterans receive. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in section 8 of this justification. This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government‘s requirements. However, the undersigned VA technical representative determined that limited competition is for the required lnsites and Centrak products. In accordance with FAR 6.302»1(c)(1)(ii)(c) and 5.106(a)(6) this justification shall be posted with the solicitation, Furthermore, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR 5.201. Any proposals that are received shall be evaluated, ~ 7. Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to conduct market research to learn if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be competed, such as redesign due to hospitai renovations or RTLS sustainment. 8. Market Research: VA technical and contracting personnel conducted market research from June through December 2018 by issuing multiple Requests for Information (RFI) on Federal Business Opportunities (F80) and by communicating with contractors involved with the current RTLS contract. A Request for Information was posted to Federal Business Opportunities on July 26, 2018, seeking information from industry regarding the installation of RTLS. The RFI included a summary of the Performance Work Statement, which stated that the Page 3 of 7 Real Time Location System, VISN 1 Control Number: TAO-1961825 contractor shall provide an RTLS solution using the existing hardware and software Nine responses were received as follows: Company Veterans Engineering Standard Communications, Inc. _S_yms Strategic Group, LLC HRUCKUS LLC RJY Group MGM Kambrian HCI Management Services Company (HCIMS) nght Professional IT Services LLC The contractors were requested to provide a summary of their technica capability to meet the requirements, including any specific experience with similar requirements. However, Veterans Engineering, Standard Communications, Inc, Syms Strategic Group, HRUCKUS, RJY, MGM, Kambrian, and HCI provided alternative RTLS solutions, and did not integrate the existing equipment. Only By Light Professional provided a response that indicated their ability to meet VA’s needs. To help clarify the requirement, VA provided additional questions on the initial RFI, which included requesting respondents to describe their ability to partner with Centrak and Intelligent Insites. In addition, a separate RFI was issued on November 29, 2018, which directly informed industry that VA intends to issue a Request for Proposal on an Other Than Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR 6.3024, and provided additional information on the use of Centrak and Intelligent Insites. Six responses were received, as shown below: Company MGM Computer Systems, Inc Knight Sky, LLC Nitor, Inc Shipcom Wireless Enterprise Sen/ices RJY Group, LLC Page 4 of 7 Real Time Location System, VISN 1 Control Number: TAC-19—51825 MGM, Knight Sky, Shipcom,and Nitor included a description of alternative RTLS solutions These RTLS products were not compatible with the existing infrastructure and the responses failed to address VA’s requirements to complete installation and testing of the existing Intelligent Insites and Centrak items. To follow up a final time, the contracting specialist emailed each of the respondents on December 19, 2019 and asked them to confirm that they understood that VA was not looking for a new RTLS solution and that the awarded contractor will be required to partner with Centrak and Intelligent Insites. Only RJY and Knight Sky responded, and both stated they understood the requirement and can partner with both. In addition, based on previous contracts and their response to the RFI, it is known that Enterprise Services is also capable, as they were the prime contractor on the initial National RTLS contract. No objections were received on VA’s intent to award on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis. In addition, neither Centrak nor Intelligent Insites responded to either RFI. Previous communication with both contractors also determined that they require a separate prime contractor for this requirement, as they were not interested in the being the prime contractor. Based on this market research, the Government's technical experts have determined that Centrak and Intelligent Insites are required to complete the requirement. 9.

Authority cited: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 1901 as implemented by FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii), sole source under the authority of the simpliﬁed procedures for certain commercial items. 5. Reason for Authority Cited: Reason for Authority Cited: T-System, Inc. is the original manufacturer of the software listed above. Due to the proprietary nature of the software. only authorized T-System Field Support Engineers can provide the required sen/ice, which is essential for continuity In maintaining the current level of patient care. Defense Health Agency (DHA) and MEDCOM Gs has identiﬁed T—System as an established and acceptable source for Emergency Departments within MEDCOM and agrees should stay in place with current contractor until MHS Genesis is implemented. Consideration for changing to a competing EDIS would have a signiﬁcant negative impact on the Emergency Department. The time needed for incorporating a new EDIS for the department staff (36 providers. 66 nurses. 36 medics,18 administrative staff) is estimated to require one full week of training at a cost of approximatel . The replacement process of installing a new vendor‘s EDIS software would a e approximately two months by conservative estimates. lnforrnation Management Division (IMD) at TAMC estimates two Full Time Employees (FTE) for 176 hours equating to approximately- for implementing and training on a new system. in addition to a gap in EDIS coverage. no other program will be able to interface with the TAMC laboratory since current DHA policy states no \"new interfaces\" in light of the anticipated MHS Genesis. This would be a significant loss of function as the T-System EV currently allows direct interfacing to all lab ordering and lab resulting functions. For Ofﬁcial Use Only (See FAR 2.101 and 3.104-4) (25 February 2016) 1 Control Number: 19-RHCO-P-188 Software License and Remote Technical Support Services for TAMC. HI The T-System EV EDIS performs patient tracking and data mining of 98% of the medical records. generation of metrics on patient throughput, and the formulation of proper stafﬁng levels. This data can be utilized in real-time, which increases patient safety and enables staff to stay ahead of bottlenecks with web-based access and an advanced notiﬁcation system that generates and distributes alerts for metrics such as inﬂow] outﬂow ration. occupancy. and capacity. These features also reduce patient wait times and length of stay. Users can also design, create, and manage multi—dimensional reports and share these reports, which improve cost controls. revenue recovery, and staff management. Additionally. the T-System EV supports concurrent nurse/physician charting allowing for better interaction and infomiational awareness. and the generation of a clear text medical report that legally dependable. The software also provides feedback identifying coding compliance or non-compliance, which signiﬁcantly reduces errors. T-System EV uses a patented articulate text engine where users can circle positive ﬁnding/backslash negative ﬁndings. and the marks are then automatically converted to articulate text. This feature allows users to quickly input pertinent information about patients while still producing a robust textual narrative that is usable across the care continuum. 6.

As required by FAR l3.106-3(b)(3)(i), this memorandum explains the absence of competition for this acquisition, as only one source will be solicited for this requirement (or for a portion of the requirement) and the requirement is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. II. DESCRIPTION OF ITEM OR SERVICE: Applications engineering support as a product and support visits for the Teradyne Microﬂex SoC located at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division. The Terad ne MicroFlex is a com Iex analog/mixed signal microelectronic circuit tester. It is used to Period of Performance: contract award through December 3 l, 2019‘ III.

To make a change now in product would cause the government to incur additional cost for purchase of licenses that could be approximately $100,000. 2) Cost of the customization of each of the soﬂware installations for each of the agency divisions. The agency paid time and materials as well as travel costs for the OEM conSUItant to conﬁgure the individual help desk database instances onsite at the cost of between $6,800 to $10,000 per database, or a total of approximately $70,000 for customization. 3) Cost of Training staff. Selecting a different product would require all of the staff ineach of the divisions using the soﬁware for their individual databases to be trained on a different soﬁware packager Training is estimated for approximately twenty personnel at $5,000 per person, or a total $100,000 for training. 4) Time of implementation: The implementation of each help desk database required approximately 3 to 4 months to plan, conﬁgure and deploy to production for each of the seven help desk databases. The organizational time and staff cost to change to a different help desk soﬁware database for each of the Agency divisions using the current software wouldtake approximately 12 - 15 months of agency staff time to complete adeployment. Implementation costs would equal approximately $25,300. Court Services and Offender SupervisionAgency Page 4 All of the above impacts results in additional costs to the Agency to cover the training and implementation in the amount of approximately $275,300 versus the estimated price of $24,357 for the software renewal for the base year and $125,000 for all ﬁve years requested, Removing the DevTrak application from operation or switching services to another platform would detrimentally disrupt the agency mission and could cause unnecessary work stoppages and interruptions In addition to the time and costs mentioned above, moving to a new system is not in the best interest of the government at this crucial time, 5.

Identiﬁcation of the agency and contracting activity: The Defense Health Agency (DHA) J -4 Contracting Activity responsible for this action will be the Contracting Ofﬁce-Falls Church, 7700 Arlington Blvd, Falls Church, VA 22042, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303-l(a). 2. Nature and/or Description of Action being approved: The proposed action is for a commercial scientiﬁc service that will extract, analyze and grade data from publically—available sources using commercial soﬁware to demonstrate Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). This is a sole-source award to Georgetown University. 3. Description of Supplies/Services: The goal is to continue a previous sole source contract (W8 I XWH-l 5-C-Ol 70, expired 29 Sep ml 7) to utilize an existing global mapping tool to demonstrate AMR and will be made available to Department of Defense (DoD) stakeholders, including Geographic Combatant Commanders, Service Surgeon Generals, other DoD leaders in force health protection measures These services will also inform treatment options of doctors and other healthcare providers within the Military Health System. As a secondary beneﬁt ofthis tool, it may be referenced by the global public health community: universities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO). AMR is a growing global threat and a growing concern in treating the warﬁghter, veterans and civilians. These services will allow for inclusion of actual conﬁrmatory laboratory results, have the ability to overlay multiple related factors to the problem of antibiotic resistance, provide modeling and predictive capabilities, and grading ofall derived data in order to optimize assessments and conclusions. Although many surveillance systems exist, as do databases of AMR information, none are complete from a global perspective, nor are graded with respect to the quality ofdata. The AMR mapping tool will rely on data searches, manuscripts, andjoumals to help establish the incidence of AMR pathogens and transmission trends where as other surveillance tools use laboratory conﬁrmation of samples to track disease trends. The countries in which the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) - Global Emerging Infectious Surveillance (GEIS) Section is focusing on do not have a ﬁrm public health infrastructure where the data is freely available and in some instances, there is not a laboratory surveillance network. The major areas ofwork with Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) that this contract will support are: Maintenance/Data Mapping Pain: 1 of‘) FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - Source Selection Information - See FAR 2.101 and 3.104 9 1’ 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - Source Selection Informatlon — See FAR 2.101 and 3.104 Enhance, maintain, update, and disseminate data and maps of global resistance pattcms including to: 0 Add data/mapping by geographic region ' Search for and add/overlay additional resistance mechanism data and mapping 0 Make available and disseminate the data and maps to the US government, the public health community, and researchers globally 0 Maintain search capacities, sources, and expertise in readiness to be utilized for emerging/urgent threats such as Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), colistin resistance, and other organisms/regions of clinical importance.

Statutory and Regulatory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302): l0 U.S.C. 2304(e)(l) 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements As per 6.302-l(a)(2)(iii)(A) for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow—on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-- Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Based on the results from the market research, this antimicrobial resistance global mapping software tool is a commercial service ofa type that is customarily available in “re commercial marketplace. There are also other similar tools on the market used by the CDC (focused on the United States) and WHO that does not focus certain countries of interest to GElS. Speciﬁcally, Georgetown has been able to ﬁnd over I40 additional data sources/studies on the following African countries (in no particular order): South Africa, Namibia, Angola, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, Algeria, Morocco, Westem Sahara, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Cote d’lvoire, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Democratic Republic ofCongo, Central African Republic, Chad, Zambia, Kenya, and Uganda. There are no other maps currently developed that provide data on the prevalence of carbapenem- resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) pathogens on a global scale‘ Also, the data would have to be collected from multiple open source publications and thoroughly analyzed and graded, which Georgetown has already done for the continent of Africa. Based on the market research, there are responsible parties that can develop a new software or tool in order to fulﬁll this requirement. Unfortunately for this requirement, the funding will not support the development of soﬂware or another mapping tool. An estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated (if this action was competed) is 5” . This contract is a follow-on from two previous years of GEIS funding, totaling $‘_. To compete these highly specialized services would be essentially starting from scratch with a new team and duplicating previously efforts that the Government has already purchased. Georgetown University has personnel with subject matter expertise and infrastructure required for successful performance and the necessary skillsets to complete this effort without a loss of efﬁciency and impact to the DHA for analysis and coordination of the tasks and activities as part of the CAB initiative. It will be time effective and cost efﬁcient to utilize the resources already on contract for the past two years to continue the requirements and is the least costly choice for Page 3 of 9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - Source Selection Intorrnatlon — See FAR 2.101 and 3.104 o 9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - Source Selection Information — See FAR 2.101 and 3.104 the Government. The following estimate represents the cost that would be duplicated (that is not expected to be recovered through competition) if this award was made to any other source: $— for a period of2 years. This estimate was derived from the previous two years of funded work that would have to be duplicated by a new contractor. This would include hiring, training and transitioning new staff without beneﬁt ofassistance from the incumbent contractor. In other words, a new contractor would have to do the same transition, training, but also cover areas of the globe that Georgetown University has already covered. However, a new contractor would not be able to commence performance at the point where Georgetown University stopped work with simply training of new employees. A new contractor would have to duplicate two years of work , in addition to training new employees - in order to commence this work. 5. Rationale Justifying Use of the Statutory Authority Cited: In 20l5, AFHSB-GEIS (Army was the owning organization at the time) established a contract with Georgetown University to create the mapping tool before GEIS was reassigned to DHA PHD. During that partnership, GU developed and tested strategies to broadly and intensively search both scientiﬁc and non-conventional data to see whether we could accrue substantive data beyond that in available reviewsr Standardized criteria were established for study acceptance and data elements and performed GIS mapping to enhance understanding of CR5 in gap areas. The original work focused on Africa, an area important to force protection and where the WHO review only reported data on 6 of 47 nations. Since Georgetown University was previously awarded a contract to develop the mapping tool, and based on market research conducted; GU is the only vendor that can capture a global antimicrobial resistant infections mapping tool with the level ofdata only available to GU. There is no reasonable expectation, based on market research, that two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, would submit comparable offers in response to the solicitation’s expressed requirement for this type of data sources within the field of global Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) will beneﬁt from Georgetown’s data sources for many reasons; most importantly to enhance GEIS‘s support of infectious disease surveillance and outbreak response to enhance Force Health Protection (FHP) decision making in the future operating environment through direct support to the six Geographic Combatant Commands (GCC) and the global DoD laboratory network that operate in all of their areas of operation to provide early detection, prevention and response to infectious disease threats ofmilitary relevance. This strategy is executed through (I) global infectious disease surveillance to inform FHP decision making across the GCCs; (2) laboratory readiness to support global outbreak response efforts to understand infectious disease threats to US forces; (3) coordination and collaboration between the GCCs, GEIS partner laboratory network, the US. interagency. and intemational partners; and Page 4 of 9 N FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - Source Selection Information - See FAR 2.101 and 3.104 C3 0 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - Source Selection Information - See FAR 2.101 and 3.104 (4) efﬁcient and effective program administration and management at all levels. Unlike similar reports and mapping attempts, Georgetown University will use data sources not previously used such as major reference laboratories, web inquiries, and the Raptor database (which is a technology for acquiring, archiving, and accessing intemet based materials in multiple languages and exceeds the information available from HealthMap). —3eorgetown University has extensive Expertise in AMR surveillance and identifying data gaps and meets a mandated need for the DoD within the 2015 National Action Plan and also addresses aspects of Executive Order 13676, Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB). There are academic institutions such as Johns Hopkins University (i.e. JHU), government agencies National Institutes of Health, CDC, and the WHO conducting AMR pathogen surveillance; however, as shown in the chart in paragraph 8 below, these organizations are not generating a product that overlaps or duplicates the efforts of the Georgetown University (GU) project. GU has generated a mapping tool, which displays the prevalence of carbapenem- resistant enterobaeteriaceae (CRE) pathogens in countries in Africa by scouring the web for open source data. While other surveillance programs and/or mapping efforts may collect data from multiple countries, this tool is designed to consolidate data from multiple sources (e.g., publications, unpublished ﬁndings, national data, etc.) in a passive manner (rather than collecting, testing, and reporting sample results). 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: A Request for Information (RFl) was published on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) on May 2], mill. A total of seven responses were received. Please refer to the paragraph 8 below. An assessment accomplished by AFHSB-GEIS established that none of the seven respondents demonstrated the capability the Government requires. A Notice of Intent to issue this requirement solesource. shall also be posted to the FBO govemment-wide point-of-entry (OPE) website along with a copy ofthe solicitation document lAW FAR Subpart 5.2 -- Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. The approved justiﬁcation, redacted as necessary, shall be posted at the OPE along with the award notice lAW FAR Subpart 5.3 ~ Synopses ofContract Awards. 7. Determination that Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The Contracting Ofﬁcer will make a separate determination that the anticipated cost to the Government is considered fair and reasonable. This determination will include a price analysis. Page 5 of?

The Contracting Ofﬁcer shall obtain appropriate data, without certiﬁcation. on the prices at which the same or similar items have previously been sold and determine ifthe data is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price as per FAR Part l5.404-l(b)(| ). The Government expects that the proposed price will be consistent with the rates paid under the previous contract which were determined to be fair and reasonable. 8. Market Research: The AFHSB-GEIS conducted online market research and reviewed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) repons. The referenced organizations do not generate maps or mapping tools that meet the requirements listed in the PWS because the CDC only tracks cases in the United States and the African countries under surveillance are non-WHO African countries. The contractor must be able to generate a map to display the prevalence of earbapenem-resistant cnterobacteriaceae (CRE) pathogens on a global scale by scouring the web for open source data.‘ The CDC does have a map that tracks CRE Healthcare Associated Infections (HA1) bUI it does not showcase CRE pathogens located in African and SE Asian coumries.‘ _ ml. It is signiﬁcant because the CDC does not conduct surveillance in the targeted area of responsibilities listed in the contract: non-WHO African countries and E/SE Asian countries. WHO conducts AMR surveillance but does not support a mapping tool which meets the requirements listed in this PWS and there are no other Contractors or Government agencies to support this effort. A total of seven vendors responded on the suspense dale ofMay 30 20187The capabllity assessment made by AFHSB- GEIS determined the respondents did not possess the capabilities to perform the full surveillance to perform the mapping requirements.

X ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE (select all that apply): 1. X RESTRICTIVE RIGHTS. The source has established proprietary rights, limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights or secret processes in the item or service required. Teradyne owns the proprietary rights to all data, drawings, schematics and have in-house trained and licensed technical personnel. As such, Teradyne applications engineers have the expertise and in~depth knowledge of the inner workings and full capabilities of the many electronic measurement systems and subsystems within the Microﬂex tester. These elements are necessary and critical to enable both timely and accurate applications support of the Tcradyne Equipment identiﬁed above, Teradyne systems contain high voltage and personnel who are not properly trained in supporting Teradyne systems, may induce further damage to the system(s), cause personal injury and even death. 2. _ EXCLUSIVE LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

Other reason not identified above. Provide details on mission impact ifrequiremenl is not xaIicitedfrom only one source. Only Teradyne has trained and experienced applications engineers who have the expertise and in-depth knowledge ofthe inner workings and full capabilities of the many electronic measurement systems and subsystems within the Microﬂex tester. The estimated cost of purchasini this experience and knowledge from another vendor, would likely exceed-or th ours of labor to train personnel, analyze, develop, design, and configuration manage the drawings/blueprints for the system replaceable assemblies.

Guidance herein applies to FOUO information used by all JSF Program personnel during the System Design and Development (SDD) phase and the Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development (PSF D) phase of the program, This guidance supersedes any previous guidance and is effective immediately. 2. Questions regarding this policy or its implementation may be directed to Ms. Jana Moody in Security Operations at 703-601-5688. Charles R Davis, Maj Gen, USAF Program Executive Ofﬁcer Attachment: Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program Policy on Identifying and Protecting For Ofﬁcial Use Only (FOUO) Information (March 2008) DM#I37665 JOINT STRIKE FIGIITER (JSF) PROGRAM POLICY ON IDENTIFYING AND PROTECTING FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) INFORMATION (March 2008) l. Backgound. There are a many types of information that require application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons. This information is known as \"Controlled Unclassiﬁed Military Information\" (CUMI). \"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" is one type ofCUMI. This policy (based on DoD 5200.1-R) is provided to aid in the identiﬁcation of FOUO information as well as promote the proper handling and marking once identiﬁed. 2. Threat. While not classiﬁed, FOUO information has value. Evidence that this is the case is reﬂected in the collection strategies of foreign intelligence services that, in recent years, have turned increasingly to the oven collection of UNCLASSIFIED infon-nation vice the covert collection of classiﬁed information 3. Applicability. Guidelines contained herein are applicable to all personnel granted access to JSF Program FOUO information. 4. ldentifﬁng JSF FOUO Information. “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" is the designation that is applied to unclassiﬁed information that may be exempt from mandatory release to the public under the Freedom of lnfon'nation Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552). a. The FOIA speciﬁes nine exemptions that may qualify certain information to be withheld from release to the public if, by its disclosure, a foreseeable harm would occur. They are: (I) Information that is currently and properly classiﬁed. (No/e: Because F DUO is not a security classification, I/ria‘ F 01A exemplian does not apply.) (2) Information that pertains solely to the internal rules and practices of the Agency. (This exemption has two proﬁles, “high\" and “low,“ The “high” proﬁle permits withholding of a document that, if released, would allow circumvention of an Agency rule, policy, or statute, thereby impeding the agency in the conduct of its mission. The “low\" proﬁle permits withholding ifthere is no public interest in the document, and it would be an administrative burden to process the request.) (3) Information speciﬁcally exempted by a statute establishing particular criteria for withholding. The language of the statute must clearly state that the information will not be disclosed FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved for release to US; UK MOI), AUS DOD. CAN DND. DNK MOD. ITA MOD, NLD I\\lOD,, NOR MOD, and TUR MND DM#137665 (4) Information such as trade secrets and commercial or ﬁnancial information obtained from a company on a privileged or conﬁdential basis that, if released, would result in competitive harm to the company, impair the Govemment’s ability to obtain like information in the future, or protect the Govemrnent’s interest in compliance with program effectiveness. (5) Inter-Agency memoranda that are deliberative in nature; this exemption is appropriate for internal documents that are part of the decision making process and contain subjective evaluations, opinions and recommendations. (6) Information, the release of which could reasonably be expected to constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of individuals. (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that: (a) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings; (b) Would deprive a person ofa right to a fair trial or impartial adjudication; (0) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of others; (d) Disclose the identity of a conﬁdential source; (e) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or (I) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual. (8) Certain records of Agencies responsible for supervision of ﬁnancial institutions. (9) Geological and geophysical information concerning wells. b. Information that is currently and properly classiﬁed can be withheld from mandatory release under the ﬁrst exemption category. “For Ofﬁcial Use Only\" is applied to information that is exempt under one of the other eight categories. So, by deﬁnition, infomation must be unclassiﬁed in order to be designated FOUO. Ifan item of information is declassiﬁed, it can be designated FOUO ifit qualiﬁes under one oftliose other categories This means: (1) Information cannot be classiﬁed and FOUO at the same time; and (2) Information that is declassiﬁed may be designated FOUO, but only ifit ﬁts into one ofthe last eight exemption categories. FOR OFFICIAL USE ON LY Approved for release Io US; UK MOD, AUS DOD, CAN DND, DNK MOD, I'l‘A MOI). NLD l\\10D., NOR MOD, and TUR MND DMMB7665 (3) The FOIA provides that, for information to be exempt from mandatory release, it must ﬁt into one of the qualifying categories and there must be a legitimate Government purpose served by withholding it. Simply because information is marked FOUO does not mean it automatically qualiﬁes for exemption. Ifa request for a record is received, the information must be reviewed to see if it meets this dual test. On the other hand, the absence of the FOUO marking does not automatically mean the information must be released. Some types of records (for example, pcrsormcl records) are not normally marked FOUO, but may still qualify for withholding 5. FOUO Marking, Information that has been determined to qualify for FOUO status should be indicated by markings when included in documents and similar material. Markings should be applied at the time documents are draﬁed. whenever possible, to promote proper protection of the information. a. Unclassiﬁed documents and material containing FOUO information shall be marked as follows: (1) Documents will be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" at the bottom ofthe front cover (ifthere is one), the title page (ifthere is one). the ﬁrst page, and the outside of the back cover (if there is one). (2) Pages of the document that contain FOUO information shall be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" at the bottom. (3) Material other than paper documents (for example, slides, computer media, ﬁlms, etc.) shall bear markings that alert the holder or viewer that the material contains FOUO information. b. Classiﬁed documents and material containing FOUO information shall be marked as required by proper marking guidelines with FOUO information identiﬁed as follows: (1) Overall markings on the document shall follow classiﬁed information marking requircments. No special markings are required on the face of the document because it contains FOUO infon-nation. (2) Portions of the document shall be marked with their classiﬁcation as required by classiﬁed information marking requirements If there are unclassiﬁed portions that contain FOUO information, they shall be marked with “FOUO” in parentheses at the beginning of the portion. Since FOUO information is, by deﬁnition. unclassiﬁed. the “FOUO” is an acceptable substitute for the normal “U\"i FOR OFFICL-u. USE ONLY Approved for release to US; UK MOD, AUS DOD, CAN DND, DNK MOD, l'I‘A MOD, NLD MOD,, NOR MOI), and TUR MN!) DM#137665 (3) Pages of the document that contain classiﬁed information shall be marked as required by classiﬁed information marking requirements. Pages that contain FOUO information but no classiﬁed information will be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" at the top and bottom. (4) Transmittal documents that have no classified material attached, but do have FOUO attachments shall be marked with a statement similar to this one: \"Attachment is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" (5) An electronically transmitted mcssage (email) containing FOUO information shall be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” prior to the text of the message and the abbreviation \"FOUO will be reﬂected in the subject line as well. 6. FOUO Access. .ISF FOUO infomiation may be disseminated within the DoD and to DoD Contractors as necessary in the conduct of official business, FOUO information may also be released to officials in other Departments and Agencies of the Executive and Judicial Branches in pertbnnance of a valid Government function. Dissemination outside of the DoD and DOD Contractors, c.g., Congressional Staff, must be approved by the JSF/PD. Ifapproved, thc following expanded marking should be used: “This document contains information exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA. Exemption 5 applies.“ .ISF FOUO can be released to international partners within the JSF program in accordance with the current Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL). 7. FOUO Storage. During working hours, reasonable steps will be taken to minimize the risk of access to FOUO information by unauthorized personnel. Aﬁcr working hours, FOUO information will be stored to preclude unauthorized access (i.e., stored in overhead bins, desks or cabinets). 8. FOUO Transmission. a. Document Transmission. (1) Mail (First Class, Parcel Post or Fourth Class for bulk shipments). FOUO may be transmitted via the US Post Ofﬁce overnight scrvice or a US. Government contract overnight can‘ier (i.e., Federal Express). Double wrapping of FOUO is not required. (2) Hand Carry. Do not read, study or display FOUO information in any manner that may result in unauthorized disclosure (3) Facsimile. FOUO may be faxed via non-secure fax as long as the recipient is present to receive the fax on the other end. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved for release to US; UK MOD. AUS DOD, CAN DNI), DNK MOI), ITA MOD, Nlrl) MOD,, NOR MOD, and TUR MND DM#137665 b. Electronic Transmission, JSF FOUO information will be encrypted via DoD PKl-based encryption and transmitted in accordance with established JSF Infomiation Technology Policies. lfrequiremenls dictate or when DoD PKl-based encryption is unavailable, JSF Information Assurance shall be contacted for additional guidance. 9. FOUO Destruction. FOUO may be destroyed by shredding or by being placed in an approved and properly marked bum bag. Under no circumstances is FOUO material to be placed in regular trash containers for disposal. IO. FOUO Foreigg Disclosure. FOUO information on US Government automated information systems for l SF Program use must be reviewed for release to our foreign national partners when created on the system or imported from another source. If approved for release the appropriate accesses and pennissions must be set and the information must be appropriately marked (see Section |0b below). a. Personnel authorized to Release. .l SF Program personnel are required to complete Foreign Disclosure Training within 20 days of receiving their initial account on the J SF Virtual Enterprise (JVE) automated information system. Once this Foreign Disclosure training has been accomplished these individuals are authorized to release FOUO program information to J SF international partners. The J SF program individual releasing FOUO information must ensure the following: c That the material is correctly marked and identiﬁed as FOUO by current program classiﬁcation guidance; - That the information is releasable per current disclosure guidance; and 0 That the recipient has a need-to-know b. Marking Releasable FOUO Material. lnfon-nation that does not have the appropriate release statement must be protected as not releasable. if the F000 information meets the above criteria then the releascr must add the following 1 SF release statement to the material: “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY //REL TO USA, GBR MOD, [TA MOD, NLD MOD, TUR WIND, CAN DND, AUS DOD, DNK MOD and NOR MOD\" c. FOUO Generated by CPP. FOUO information authored by Cooperative Program Personnel (CPP) assigned to the JSF Program must be correctly marked and identiﬁed as FOUO by current program classiﬁcation guidance; include in the release statement the appropriate partners to whom the information may be released; and corresponding permissions applied. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved for release to US; UK MOD, AUS DOD, CAN DND, DNK MOD. ITA MOD. NLD MOI)\" NOR MOD. and TU'R MND"}

Identification of the agency and the contracting activity. This justiﬁcation is prepared by the United States Department of Justice (Department or D01) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6303-2. The requiring organization is the Civil Division's Ofﬁce of Management information. The contracting activity is the Justice Management Division, Procurement Services Staff. 2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Department intends to modify Contract 01114-02476 for website enhancement and application development/maintenance and documentation support services in support of the Civil Division’s Ofﬁce of Management Information to extend the term of the contract for a period of six months. The modiﬁcation, which will extend the contract expiration date from March 31, 2019 to September 30, 2019, will ensure continuity of mission critical services until the foilow«on procurement Is awarded. Contract DJJl4‘-C-2476 was awarded to Integrated Support Systems, Inc. [ISSI) on September 27, 2013, using competitive procedures on a total service disabled veteran- owned small business set-aside basis. The contract had a ceiling value of$15,499,643.00 and was orlglnaliy scheduled to expire on September 30, 2018. At that time, under the auspices of the option to extend services clause, the contract was extended for six months to March 31, 2019. The need to extend the current contract ls due to unanticipated delays and work stoppages encountered by the Government while conducting the follow-on procurement. 3. Description of-the supplies or services required, Including the estimated value. Under Contract 01114-02476, the contractor will furnish application development and maintenance support services for the Civil Division's Office of Management Information The total estimated value for the extension Is $422,188.30. 4. Identiﬁcation of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302—1 m JOFOC to Extend the Term a] comma 11111451476 Page 1 entitled, \"Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.\" 5. Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor‘s Unique Qualiﬂutlons or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited. iSSi has been performing the case information support services on their respective contract since October 2013. They have done so in an effective and highly capable manner and have proven to be indispensable in meeting the case Information support services of the Department The inability to continue services with the contractor while completing the re-procurement process would severely impact the Department‘s mission. ISSi Is currently meeting all of the critical case Information support services of the requirements cited above, and there is no other existing contract vehicle available throughout the Government that provides these same services that can be used as an immediate alternative. This makes the contractor uniquely qualiﬁed to provide the Department‘s mission critical services while the Department works to transition to the follow-on contract. 6. Description of efforts made to solicit offers from as many sources as practicable, Including publication per FAR Subpart 5.2. As noted above, the Department is working on the follow-on procurement. The Department has determined that it would not be practicable to conduct a limited competition to award a short-term bridge to avoid gaps In service while the competition for the follow-on contract is In process. Given the scope of services and the lack of time to conduct such a limited competition (for a bridge contract), Including the process of Issuing a solicitation, obtaining proposals, conducting an evaluation, and making award, and the need for a possible transition period, the Department determined that such a competition was neither feasible nor In the best interest ofthe Government. Even In the best-case scenario, the limited competition for the bridge contract would take at least several months and require that the Department shift resources from the follow—on competition to the short-term bridge competition, thus further delaying award of the follow-on contract. For the aforementioned reasons, the Department concluded that soliciting an offer to extend services from the Incumbent contractor was in the best interest of the Government. The Department intends to solicit the follow~on procurement under the Information Technology Support Services (ITSS-S) Program. The ITSS-S Is a competitive multiple award, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract designed to provide speciﬁc IT services to DOJ components at the task order level. In accordance with FAR 5.202(a), synopsis is not required when: (6) the proposed contract action is an order placed under Subpart 16.5. 7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. W John: to Extend the Tenn 0/ Contract DUN-62476 Page 2 As noted in Section 2, the current contract was awarded using competitive procedures on a total service disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside basis. Contract prices for the base period and all option periods were determined to be fair and reasonable based on adequate competition among the proposals received, Prices offered for the extension period will be compared with historical prices paid under the contract. Furthermore, the Contracting Officer will work with the incumbent contractor to maintain the current contract pricing, ensuring that prices for the extension period are fair and reasonable. 8. Description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. As explained in Section 6 above, the Department considered the possibility of a competitively awarded bridge contract but determined that this was neither feasible nor practicable nor In the best interest of the Government. The Department has determined that further market research in support ofthe extension period would not yield meaningful additional information. 9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. There are no additional facts to be reported in this section. 10. List of the sources, it any, that expressed, In writing, an Interest in the acquisition. No sources have expressed interest In the extension period. 11. Statement of the actions, If any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services req uirod. As discussed above, actions are underway to complete a competitive follow—on procurement for this requirement. 12. Certiﬁcations, _Concurrences and Approval.

This becomes troublesome ﬁom an [A perspective because when there are security vulnerabilities that need to be patched. we would ﬁrst have to wait for the vendor to not only patch the big data libraries but also patch the additional software layer they use. This sometimes will prolong the time it takes to patch the system. Since Hortonworks does not have this additional software layer and only uses the Apache big data libraries, it does not have this issue. Also, we do not have another group such as NAVAlR or the Army that has proven that they can get Cloudera accredited on a classiﬁed enclave.

Level of effort is full time (40 hours per week). Abuja, Federal Republic of Nigeria Employment Authorization / Facilities Access Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with an estimated annual growth rate of 2.4% and total population of approximately 186 million in 2016. It is made up of six geopolitical zones, 36 states @lus the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja), and 774 local government areas, each with an average population of about 240,000 residents. Each state has an elected governor, an executive council, and a house of assembly with the power to make state laws‘ State governments have substantial autonomy and exercise considerable authority over the allocation and utilization of their resources, limiting the inﬂuence of the federal government over state and local government affairs. Senior Health Advisor, Health systems and Strategic Information Solicitation #72062019B00004 Nigeria is ranked 152 out of 188 countries in the 2015 United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index. Under-ﬁve mortality is estimated at 128 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality is estimated at 576 per 100,000 live births (Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2013). For nearly all socioeconomic indicators, the south of the country is signiﬁcantly better off than the north, but recent downturns in the international oil markets combined with lowered production due to rebels targeting oil production have led to economic stagnation over the past year. The total fertility rate (TFR) is still high in Nigeria at 5.5 children per woman (NDHS 2013) and only 10 percent of currently married women are using a modern contraceptive method. However, there are remarkable variations in contraceptive use among currently man‘ied women according to the gee—political zone: contraceptive use is highest in the South West geopolitical zone (38%), followed by the South East (29%), South South (28%), North Central (16%), North West (4%), and North East (3%). In Nigeria, 38 percent of births are delivered by a skilled health provider while 36 percent of all deliveries take place in health facilities. About 61 percent of mothers reported consulting a skilled health provider —a doctor, nurse, midwife, or auxiliary midwife —at least once for antenatal care for the most recent birth in the ﬁve-year period before the survey, and only 53 percent of the last births were fully protected against neonatal tetanus. The newborn mortality rate is 37 per 1,000 live births and total under one mortality rate is 69 per 1,000 infants. Under-5 and infant mortality rates are estimated at 128 and 69 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively. Overall, 25 percent of children age 12-23 months are fully vaccinated, however again there is tremendous coverage range from state to state with USAID focus states demonstrating some of the lowest coverage rates. Based on WHO and UNICEF estimates, Nigeria has the second highest number of unimmunized children globally — a staggering estimate of 3.8 million children in the country go unimmunized each year. Nationwide 37 percent of children under age 5 are stunted (too short for their age), 18 percent are considered wasted (too thin for their height), and 29 percent are underweight (low weight-for-age. However, the prevalence of severe malnutrition has increased signiﬁcantly with the increasing level of conﬂict in the Northeast. In the USAID/Nigeria’s Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), approved Augist, 201 S, the Mission outlined its vision in “reducing extreme poverty and creating a stable Nigeria” through a focus on improving the governance of key sectors in order to better mobilize and utilize Nigerian government resources. The Health Project‘s contribution to the Mission’s goal is to strengthen the responsiveness of the GON to the poor health conditions in the country so that ending preventable maternal and child deaths will be realized. HPN will work together with all levels of government to strengthen management and operational capacities and bolster reforms to prioritize, allocate, and disburse budgets to ensure that health services are delivered to citizens, particularly the poor. The Project is directly linked to Development Objective 2: A healthier, more educated population in targeted states. This position is located within the Health, Population, and Nutrition (HPN) Ofﬁce. HPN manages programs in maternal and child health, family planning/reproductive health, malaria, nutrition, polio eradication, neglected tropical diseases, and health systems strengthening (H88). 3 Senior Health Advisor. Health Systems and Strategic Information Solicitation #72062019B00004 As a multi—sectoral initiative, many activities of the HIV/AID and TB, education, economic growth, and democracy and governance Ofﬁces are intimately integrated with the activities of the HPN portfolio. USAID’s annual health sector budget in Nigeria, excluding HIV/AIDS and TB funding is approximately $170 million. The HPN Ofﬁce works under the framework of the Global Health Initiative and embodies the principles and technical priorities outlined in the Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths (EPCMD), the President’s Malaria Initiative, and other key health actions, including the Nigerian Ministry of Health’s Saving One Million Lives (SOML) Initiative. Concerted efforts are being made to improve maternal and child mortality and morbidity rates as well as unlocking the potential for social development and economic grth through scale-up of evidence-based, high impact, cost effective interventions. Key focal areas include but are not limited to prevention and treatment of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia,- expanding access to quality family planning services; strengthening routine immunization and new life saving vaccines; improving nutrition; and, elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV. Efforts to strengthen health systems include the private sector, human resources for health, strategic information, leadership and health governance, and supply chain management. Improved health seeking behavior through behaviour change communication, demand creation and advocacy at individual, household, community and facility level are critical to the HPN efforts. Continuous quality improvement cuts across all elements of the HPN portfolio. B. BASIC FUNCTION The Senior Health Advisor is a senior member of the HPN Ofﬁce.

Title of Project: Insider Threat Division Support Services 2. BACKGROUND: The Presidential Memorandum Issued 21 November 2012, “National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs” directs that the Insider Threat Program must gather, integrate, centrally analyze and respond to threat-related information As part of the program, the ITD is responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and analysis of automated data streams from internal and external data sources for identifying anomalous behavior, which may indicate Insider Threat activity and/or identify the misuse of information systems and information. To perform this function, the ITD maintains a user activity monitoring (UAM) system, as well as an analysis and correlation tool, to ingest data from various data sources that reside on the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS), Secure Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNet) and Non-secure Internet Protocol Network (NIPRnet). The resulting data is aggregated and normalized to enable risk analysis. 3. OBJECTIVES: This is a non-personal services contract to provide technical support services to the Defense Intelligence Agency Insider Threat Division (ITD). The analysis and correlation tool currently utilized by the ITD is the Insider Threat and Analysis Correlation Tool (ITACT). This tool relies on receipt of automated data streams from disparate sources and provides an integrated view into all the collected data related to employee status and U A M monitoring to enable detection of high-risk behavior among personnel. The quality and effectiveness of the tool requires software coding of policies designed to identify user computer activity and behaviors determined by the Govemment to be potentially indicative of anomalous behavior that may put DIA personnel, information, systems, and/or facilities at risk. This includes implementing and utilizing tools, such as behavior normalization, to deﬁne and establish a baseline for “normal” behavior, and deﬁning and creating data models for persistent risk analysis of personnel against the prioritized data sets. Through risk analysis, the system alerts analysts to suspicious and/or anomalous behavior for review. The primary objective is to provide both a reactive and proactive capability that optimizes mitigation and prevents outcomes detrimental to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) undertaken by an Insider Threat. The ITD continues to research and implement advanced capabilities and tools in the realm of data correlation, machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence to meet or exceed predictive and risk analysis goals. SCOPE: Currently the DIA/Insider Threat Group utilizes a Govemment-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) tool, the Insider Threat Analysis and Correlation Tool (ITACT), to ingest different data sources and visualize the data. ITACT is built on ColdFusion and runs on a standard Windows 10 baseline The scope of the new contract will span consulting, in-depth product knowledge, solution integration, product enhancement, implementation and integration, product support, system engineering, architectural assessment, classiﬁed technical support, and testing. The scope will also include current operation and maintenance of the ITACT Page 2 of 15 capability and the continued engineering and development to evolve and enhance DIA’s Insider Threat Program capabilities based on current and emerging technologies, such as data analytics, machine learning, and artiﬁcial intelligence. Contract efforts will enhance the ITD’s ability to deter, detect, analyze and mitigate the Insider Threat.

OTHER INFORMATION This solicitation contains the following Defense Intelligence Agency Acquisition Regulation Supplement & Instruction (DARSI) provision: 1052.209-98 UTILIZATION OF SUPPORT CONTRACTORS BY THE GOVERNMENT (FEB 2009) a. Offerors are advised that non-govemment employees will serve as evaluators for assisting the government during evaluation of cost/price portions of the proposals. The government will authorize such personnel access only to those portions of the proposal data pertaining to cost/price information. They shall be expressly prohibited from scoring, ranking, or recommending the selection of a source, b. The Government is responsible for proper safeguards to ensure proposal evaluation objectivityi In this regard, the government exclusively retains all source selection decision authority and supporting decision responsibilities. Moreover, all participants in the proposal review process with access to source selection sensitive information are required to execute a government nondisclosure agreement. c, The Government support contractor that will be involved in reﬁew of cost/price portions of the proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be: E3 Federal Solutions d. Offerors who submit proposals in response to this solicitation do so with the express understanding that government support contractors serving as advisors in the proposal review process may have access to the Offerors’ cost/price portion of the proposal information, as described above. Offerors requiring nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) with any government support contractor are not relieved of solicitation submission time requirements, nor is the Government required to provide additional time to Offerors requiring their own bilateral nondisclosure agreements with any government support contractors. 11 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD e. Offerors requiring NDAs with any government support contractor shall: (i) Inform the contracting oﬂicer of the Offerors’ requirement; (ii) Contact the Government support contractor and negotiate the necessary terms and conditions and obtain the contractor’s written agreement; (iii) With the proposal submission, provide a signed copy of each executed nondisclosure agreement to the contracting ofﬁcer; and (iv) Indicate in the proposal that the support contractor(s) may utilize the Offerors’ proprietary data in evaluating the Offerors’ proposal. f. The Offeror shall notify its prospective subcontractor(s) who are submitting proprietary information that the above government support contractors may require similar access to this information. Any such subcontractors may execute agreements directly with the above government support contractors or may authorize an Offeror to permit such access on such reasonable terms as the subcontractor may provide. For each such subcontractor agreement executed, Offerors shall provide copies of such agreements within their proposals, and shall indicate in the proposals that the government support contractor(s) may utilize subcontractor proprietary data in evaluating the subcontractor's proposal for this acquisition. (End of Provision) 12. AMENDMENTS Amendments to the solicitation will be announced on the web page www.ﬂ)o.gov . It is the Offerors’ responsibility to review this location periodically for updates and/or amendments. 13. DISCUSSIONS The Government does not contemplate holding discussions, however, it reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary. The primary objective of discussions is to maximize the Govemment‘s ability to obtain best value, based on the requirement and the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. lf discussions are necessary due to perceived weaknesses or other issues that must be addressed before award, the Government will evaluate all Offeror’s proposals in accordance 12 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD with FAR 52.2124 and establish the competitive range. Based on ratings of each proposal against ALL evaluation criteria, the Contracting Ofﬁcer will establish the competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efﬁciency. If the Contracting Ofﬁcer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efﬁcient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Ofﬁcer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efﬁcient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Discussions resulting from the competitive range determination may be conducted in writing and/or in verbal discussions as follows: Written and/or verbal discussions will be utilized by issuing Evaluation Notices (ENS). The Contracting Ofﬁcer will issue ENS to Offerors within the competitive range to communicate those areas of his or her proposal which are considered deficient, where weaknesses exist, or where other aspects of the Offeror’s proposal (such as cost, price, technical/management capability, past performance and terms and conditions) are signiﬁcant enough to affect the selection decision and/or where data presented by the Offeror is unclear. l4. PROPOSAL REVISIONS Revisions to either the technical or Price proposal shall have changed information clearly marked by a vertical line in the right margin of the page. Offerors are cautioned that changes or revisions at the ﬁnal proposal revision stage may render a proposal unacceptable for award. 15. COMMENT TYPES The evaluation will include, as appropriate, the determination of signiﬁcant strengths, strengths, weaknesses, signiﬁcant weaknesses, and deﬁciencies. 16. CLARIFICATIONS Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or to resolve minor or clerical errors. 13 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD 52.212-2 EVALUATION — COMMERCIAL ITEMS This is a best value evaluation conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regtlation (FAR) Part 15.101-1, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement (DFARS), and the BIA Acquisition Regulation Supplement Instruction (DARSI). The Government will award to the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of 8(a) Status/Certiﬁcation, Facility Security Clearance Status, Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Price. The award will be made to the Offeror who is deemed responsible and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation‘s requirements and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent best value to the Government The Government seeks to award to the Offeror who gives the greatest conﬁdence that it will best meet, or exceed, the stated requirements. This may result in an award to a higher rated and/or higher priced Offeror: for example where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the higher ranked non-price factor responses of the higher Price Offeror outweighs the price difference, The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or to other than the Offeror with the highest technical score if the SSA determines that do so would result in the best value to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a signiﬁcantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical and management features. The Government may reject any and all offers if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. 8(a) Status/Certiﬁcation and Facility Security Clearance are pass-fail gateway factors that the Government will evaluate first. Of those offerors who pass both gateway factors, the Government will select the best overall offer based on the Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Cost/Price. Evaluation factors other than Price, when combined, are SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN Cost/Price in the award decision. Technical Approach is the most important non-price factor, followed by Past Performance. Price becomes increasingly more important in award selection when other criteria are substantially equal. This process permits trade-offs among Price and non-price factors and allows the Government to select other than the lowest Price proposal, or other than the highest technically rated offer. If the Government decides that it is necessary to hold discussions, then a Competitive Range determination will be made based upon the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria. The Government intends to award the contract without discussion with Offerots; however, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions, Therefore, the Offeror’s initial proposal shall contain the Offeror’s best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Ofﬁcer determines them to be necessary. 14 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD The Government may or may not establish a competitive range aﬁer evaluating all proposals. If discussions are to be conducted, a competitive range will be established prior to the commencement of discussions. Based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria7 the Contracting Ofﬁcer may establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efﬁciency. EVALUATION PROCEDURES Factor 1: 8(a) Status/Certiﬁcation is a pass/fail. Factor 2: Facility Security Clearance Status is a pass/fail. Factor 3 - Technical Approach will receive one of the overall adjectival ratings described in Table 3, Combined Technical/Risk Ratings. Factor 4 — Past Performance will receive one rating described in Table 5, Past Perfonnance Conﬁdence Assessments Rating Method. Factor 5 — Cost/Price will be evaluated separate and apart from factors 1, 2, 3 and 4. The proposal will address the following five (5) factors: Factor 1: 8(a) Status/Certiﬁcation (Pass/Fail) Factor 2: Facility Security Clearance Status (Pass/Fail) Factor 3: Technical Approach Factor 4: Past Performance Factor 5: Cost/Price FACTOR l: 8(a) Status/Certiﬁcation The Government will verify the 8(a) status of the Offeror by reviewing documented proof of status as veriﬁed through the Small Business Administration (SBA) office as submitted within the proposal. If the Offeror does not receive a “Pass” in Factor 1: 8(a) Status/Certiﬁcation, til—e proposal will not be evaluated further. Table 1. 8(a) Status/Certiﬁcation Rating Description Pass The Prime Offeror, at the time of proposal submission, has a current - VERIFIED 8(a) status. Fail The Prime Offeror, at the time of proposal submission, DOES NOT have a current - VERIFIED 8(a) status. 15 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD FACTOR 2: Facility Security Clearance Status The Government will evaluate the security Factor on a Pass-Fail rating. If the Offeror does not receive a “Pass” in Factor 2: Security, the proposal will not be evaluated further. An “INTERIM” for Facility Clearance WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Offeror shall provide their CAGE code identifying that the Prime Offeror has 8 TOP SECRET facility clearance. The definitions for the ratings are provided in Table 2 below Table 2. Security Ratings Rating Description Pass The Prime Oﬂ‘eror, at the time of proposal submission, has a TOP SECRET facility clearance. Fail The Prime Offeror, at the time of proposal submission, DOES NOT have a TOP SECRET facility clearance. FACTOR 3: Technical Approach Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with this factor to assess whether the proposal demonstrates understanding of the threshold performance or capability requirements through an assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, deﬁciencies, and risks of a proposal. Evaluations shall be in accordance with the criteria established in the solicitation Based on the information received by the Government as described in the Instructions to Offerors, the Government will evaluate how well the proposal addresses the elements of the Technical Approach. Proposals will receive one combined technical/risk rating for this factor. This rating will reﬂect the degree to which the proposed approach reﬂects a technical expertise and clear understanding of the tasks enumerated in Section 6: Tasks of the Statement of Work (SOW), and the proposed approach for furnishing labor. Speciﬁcally, the Government will assess Offerors’ approaches for: - Maintaining the current Insider Threat Analysis Correlation Tool (ITACT); o Maintaining mitigating and sharing capabilities as they relate to the IT ACT; and 0 Developing soﬁware within the Insider Threat program, to include maintaining Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) soﬁware products, developing new data structures and systems conﬁguration capabilities, data modeling capabilities, web development as well as understanding Insider Threat enterprise networks. The Government will also evaluate the degree to which the proposed approach includes a sound and feasible staffing plan and management plan. 16 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD In craﬁing the stafﬁng plan, Offerors should describe the their ability to recruit and retain personnel who have the qualiﬁcations and experience to successfully meet the SOW requirements to include but not limited to, use of incentives to retain qualiﬁed personnel; policy on continuing education, professional development and periodic retraining of personnel; and capability to meet surge requirements. They should also address previous challenges and present mitigation strategies used to maintain stafﬁng levels, In craﬁing the management plan, Offerors should detail how they intend to provide Program Management support in accordance with the SOW. Speciﬁcally, the Government will assess Offerors’ proposals for how they: - Describe processes used to successfully identify, screen, select, and hire personnel for positions and ensure success of these processes. 0 Demonstrate the Offeror’s ability to maintain stafﬁng requirements for this requirement. 0 Demonstrate the offeror’s ability to manage staff for a requirement of this complexity and magnitude Deﬁnitions 1. Signiﬁcant Strength is an aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that appreciably enhances the merit of a proposal or appreciably increases the probability of successful contract performance. 2‘ Strength is an aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has merits or exceeds speciﬁed performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance. 3. Signiﬁcant Weakness in the proposal is a ﬂaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful] contract performance 4. Weakness means a ﬂaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. 5. Deﬁciency is a material failure of a proposal to meet Government requirement(s) or a combination of signiﬁth weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. Combined technical/risk rating includes consideration of the risk in conjunction with the strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deﬁciencies in determining technical ratings. Combined technical/risk evaluations shall utilize the combined technical/risk ratings listed in Table 3. Combined Technical/Risk Rating Method. 17 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD Table 3: Combined Technical/Risk Ratings Rating Description Outstanding Proposal indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements and contains multiple strengths, and risk of unsuccessful performance is low. Good Proposal indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements and contains at least one strength, and risk of unsuccessful performance is low to moderate, Acceptable Proposal indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. Marginal Proposal has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of unsuccessful _performance is high. Unacceptable Proposal does not meet requirements of the solicitation, and thus, contains one or more deﬁciencies, and/or risk of unsuccessful performance is unacceptable. Proposal is un—awardable. FACTOR 4: Past Performance The past performance evaluation results in an assessment of the Offeror’s probability of meeting tlte solicitation requirements. The past performance evaluation considers each Offeror’s demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying services that meet the contract’s requirements. In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2), the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor’s performance shall be considered These are combined to establish one performance conﬁdence assessment rating for each offeror. There are three (3) aspects to the past performance evaluation: recency, relevancy (including context of data), and quality (including general trends in contractor performance and source of information): Recency.— Past performance references will be considered Recent only if they meet both the following two criteria: - \"lite referenced effort was completed within 3 years of the date that proposals are due (or is work that is still ongoing); and o The referenced effort was performed for at least 1 year. (This 1 year of performance requirement applies to referenced efforts that have already been completed within 4 years of the date that proposals are due as well as referenced efforts that are still ongoing. In other words, both types of references (those completed and those still ongoing) must have 1 year of performance to be considered recent.) 18 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD Relevance. The second is to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the offeror is to the effort to be acquired through the source selection. The following criteria \\m‘ll be incorporated to establish what prior performance is relevant: 0 Does the past performance indicate relevant experience with Insider Threat Support Services? 0 Does the past performance indicate related systems architecture being performed within the Government domain? a Does the past performance indicate sufﬁcient implementation, maintenance, and upgrade support for systems architecture? 0 Does the past performance indicate relevant capabilities in performing web application development? 0 Does the past performance indicate relevant web application development (including integration with database systems, custom conﬁguration of web interfaces, development and modiﬁcation of layouts? . Does the past performance indicate the latest COTS & Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) soﬁware products within a government-related network? There are four (4) levels of relevancy as shown in Table 4. Past Performance Relevancy Rating Method. With respect to relevancy, past performance of greater relevancy will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more inﬂuence on the past performance conﬁdence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance Table 4. Past Performance Relevancy Rating Method Adjectival Rating Description Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. ﬁnally of Products or Services. The third aspect of the past performance evaluation is to establish the overall quality of the offeror’s past performance (See FAR 15.304(c)(2)). The past performance evaluation conducted in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror’s past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts. The evaluation team will review all past performance, general trends, and usefulness of the information and incorporate these into the 19 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD performance conﬁdence assessment. A separate quality assessment rating will not be given; rather, the past performance conﬁdence assessment rating is based on the offeror’s overall record of recency, relevancy, and quality of performance. In conducting the past performance evaluation, the Government may use data included by Offerors in their proposals, including three (3) contracts for the prime Offeror, past performance questionnaires, as well as, past performance information obtained from other sources to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; the Defense Contract Management Agency; and possible interviews with Program Managers and Contracting Ofﬁcers, Adverse past performance information will be evaluated and included as part of the conﬁdence assessment. Performance Conﬁdence Assessment Given the intricate nature of the current requirement, the SSEB shall use all conﬁdence ratings identiﬁed in Table 5. Past Performance Conﬁdence Assessments Rating. In the case of Offerors for which there is no information on past contract performance or where past contract performance information is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance (see FAR 15t305(a)(2)(iv))t In this case, the offeror’s past performance is unknown and assiyied a performance conﬁdence rating of “neutral.” Although the SSEB may not rate an offeror that lacks recent, relevant past performance favorably or unfavorably with regard to past performance, the SSA, in revieng the ﬁndings of the SSEB, may determine a rating of Satisfactory Conﬁdence instead of a “neutral” outcome. in a best value tradeoff as long as the determination is consistent with stated solicitation criteria 20 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD Table 5. Past Performance Conﬁdence Assessments Rating Method Rating Description Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory Conﬁdence Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort Neutral Confidence No recent/relevant performance record is available or offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful conﬁdence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance. Limited Conﬁdence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No Confidence Based on the Offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able successfully perform the required effort. FACTOR 5: Cost/Price The Government will determine the reasonableness of the overall cost/price based on the proposal analysis techniques contained in FAR 15 .404-1. The overall price to be evaluated will be the applicable rates of the support labor categories over the intended time»periods as well as the applicable/allowable direct and indirect rates. The totals will be used in a “best value” decision. The total price shall be equal to the sum of the total proposed price for the base period and four twelve-month option periods. The evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for the 6-month option period, and adding that amount to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price. Thus, the Offeror’s total evaluated price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, option periods one through four, and all of the use of FAR 52.217-8. Evaluation of an option will not obligate the Government to exercise the option. The Government will conduct a price analysis to ensure that rate tables and other pricing data are accurate and reasonable A determination will be made as to whether the price proposals submitted by Offerors are complete in all aspects and whether the amounts submitted are calculated accurately. The determination that a total price is reasonable will be based upon information submitted with the Offeror’s proposal, review of individuals CLl'NS, comparison to the IGCE or other reasonable basis. 21"}

ONR intends to issue a sole source bridge contract to continue the support services currently provided by Vencore Services and Solutions, Inc (Vencore) under task order N00178—04‘D-4096/EE03. This bridge contract will provide continued Scientiﬁc and Engineering Technical Assistance (SETA) support services as well as general programmatic and ﬁnancial management support services in support of the ONR Expeditionary Warfare Research efforts previously conducted under Code 30. The period of performance for this bridge contract is 3 February 2019 through 2 December 2019. This bridge will also include FAR clause 52.2l7—8 “Option to Extend Services“, to potentially extend services on a month to month basis for up to an additional six months. 3. Description ofSuppIies/Seryices. The contractor shall provide SETA, General Programmatic, and Financial Management Services in Support of ONR Expeditionary Warfare Research Efforts. ONR Expeditionary Warfare Research Efforts encompass focus areas including Fires, Maneuver, Force Protection, Command Control, Communications and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Human Performance, Training and Education, Logistics, I-Iuman Social Cultural Behavioral Modeling, Naval Expeditionary Dog Program, Countering Improvised Explosive Devices, Science Addressing Asymmetric Explosive Threats, Cyber-technology and eyber~warfare The period of performance for the bridge contract is 3 February 2019 through 2 February 2020. The level of effort for this bridge contract is 26 full~time-equivalent contractor support personnel. The estimated value of this bridge contract including all other direct costs is $4,000,000.00. This bridge contract action has been reviewed and approved by the ONR Service Requirements Review Board (SRRB) under approval number ONR—I9-0001. 4. Identiﬁcation of Statutory Authority. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Only one responsible source, as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 —- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. J&A No. 02-19 5. Demonstration ofContractor’s Unique Qualiﬁcation. The current task order for these support services is set to expire on 2 February 2019. Currently, the future requirements for these support services are under consideration for signiﬁcant changes. Programs supported under the existing Vencore task order for support of Code 30 will be disseminated amongst multiple other ONR Program Ofﬁces due to the ongoing ONR Command reorganization. How these organizational changes will impact future ONR support services procurements cannot yet be deﬁned. For this reason, the requirements currently fulﬁlled by the Vencore task order Cannot be finalized for use in competitive procurement. if a five year follow-on to the existing task order were to be solicited, it would require changes to the current scope of work, including signiﬁcant revisions to the PWS and other requirements documents The ongoing changes to ONR’S support services requirements resulting from the reorganization effectively preclude ONR from issuing a solicitation and completing a competitive source selection for the services provided by the current Vencore task order prior to the current award expiration in February 2019. Vencore has been successfully performing the support services currently required for this effort under task order N00178-04-D-4096/EE03 since 3 February 2014. There is a continuing requirement for these services for ten months. Veneore is the only source that can provide the continuing support services that ONR requires without disrupting the operational capability of these Expeditionary Warfare Research efforts during the bridge period. 6. Description of Efforts to Ensure Other Potentials Sources Were Sought. Pursuant to FAR (1302-1 (d)(2). a Notice ot'lntent to Award a Sole Source was posted to the Government Wide Point ofEntry. wwwtbogov. on 21 November 20 | 8. No responses were received. 7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost The Contracting Ofﬁcer shall dctcrmine the cost to be fair and reasonable prior to award utilizing proposal analysis techniques described in FAR 15.404. 8, Description of Market Research. Market research was not conducted for this action, as it is impractical to have another contractor perform the required support services. Only the incumbent contractor can successfully provide continuity ot‘sen‘ices during the bridge period. In addition. A Notice olilntent to Award a Sole Source was posted to www.fbo.gov on 21 November 2018 and no responses were received from any other interested parties. 9, Any Other Supporting Facts. If a bridge contract is not established, there would be signiﬁcant negative impacts to the overall operations of ONR’s Expeditionary Warfare Research efforts. This impact would be recognized via the following events J&A No, 02-19 — Code 30 would fail to submit Congressional Data required to support the Marine Corps S&T portion of the President’s Budget Request at all Congressional Briefings, r The R-Z, R—Za, R-3, R-4, and R—4a exhibits would fail to be prepared in a timely manner. — Funding would suffer due to a lack of reports, data, and other required information for the Warfighting Investment Program Evaluation Board (WIPEB). — Also, funding would not be accurately provided due to a lack of planning and preparation for the United States Marine Corps R-Z activities, which serve as the baseline for other S&T programs, — Technology demonstrations would experience delays and be subject to safety hazards without the support of the Contractor to ensure compliance with DoN Human Research Protections Programs (HRPP), Laser Safety Review Board (LSRB) and National Telecommunications Information Agency (NTIA). 10. Listing of Interested Sources A Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source was posted to www.tbo.gov on 21 November 2018. No interested sources responded. ll, Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition, The conﬁrming need for these support services is for ten months, which ONR anticipates will provide sufficient time to complete the transition of the subject Expeditionary Warfare Maneuver Programs into other ONR Program Offices. This ten month period will allow continued support for current Code 30 efforts as they transition into a new ONR organizational structure. FAR clause 52217-8 is included in the event that additional support is needed prior to completion of the requirements refinement process resulting from this ONR organizational change. 12. Statement of Delivery Requirements. The contractor shall provide monthly status reports, ad hoc reports and presentations, and a ﬁnal report as described in the statement of work for the bridge contract. 13. Reference to the Approved Acquisition Plan (AP) or Equivalent Documentation. A Management and Oversights Process for the Acquisition of Services-Streamlined (MOPAS) has been approved for this requirement. 14. Explanation of all actions attempted to make the immediate acquisition competitive and the cost lbenefit analvsis reﬂectiry costs associated with obtaining competition and anticipated beneﬁts. This proposed bridge contract covers only the period of time believed necessary to support this continuing requirement. Given the relatively short duration of the bridge J&A No. 02-19 contract, no beneﬁt to the Government would be obtained by attempting to conduct a competition for the bridge effort in addition to the follow-on competition.

Agency and Contracting Activity. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Ofﬁce of Procurement Operations (0P0), Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC) proposes to award a task order pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a), Limiting Sources. 2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved, DHS/OPO intends to limit the number of sources solicited pursuant to FAR Part 8,405-6(a) for the procurement of geospatial data management and geospatial technical support services for the DHS Geospatial Management Ofﬁce (GMO) and in coordination with DHS Operations and Plans, Federal Emergency Management Agency, CyberSecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, United States Secnet Service as well as other Homeland Security Enterprise stakeholders (i.e. FBI, State Fusion Centers, Local Emergency Operation Centers). The proposed contractor is Ardent Management Consulting, Inc. (ArdentMC), 1840 Michael Faraday Drive, Suite 120, Reston VA 20190. 3. Description of Supplies/Services The scope of this requirement is to provide Geospatial Information Infrastructure (G11) operations and maintenance support services to the DHS GMO that includes support for the DHS Common Operating Picture, Homeland Inﬁ‘astructin'e Foundation Level Data (HIFLD) subcommittee, Geospatial Continuity of Operations, and other DI-IS mission essential geospatial data activities (ie National Special Security Event Data Management, South West Border geospatial data collections, etc.) as identiﬁed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary’s Uniﬁed Coordination Group (UCG), and the Joint Interagency Advisory Group. The contractor currently provides comprehensive geospatial technical support services to include program and data management, systems engineering, systems architecture design, data integration and interoperability, and ualit assurance and testing, The independent government cost estimate for this requirement is The period of performance for the proposed bridge task order is a 6-month base period With three (3) one-month option periods.

Limited-Sources Justiﬁcation (LSJ) 4. Authority and supporting rationale. This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program, 41 U.S.C. 152(3), Competitive Procedures, and 40 U.S.C. 501 Services for Executive Agencies, in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a), Limiting Sources. A task order will be issued pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized based on the following rationale: - The current GTSS BPA order HSHQDC-lS-F-00189 expires on March 29, 2019. This order was issued under DHS Blanket Purchase Agreement (EPA) HSHQDC-l3-A-00046 and this BPA expired on September 29, 2018. The new multipleaward GTSS 2.0 EPA is currently in process and the target award date is in June 2019. The new GTSS 2.0 BPA was scheduled to be awarded by March 2019; however, the target award date of the new EPA has been pushed back due to unexpected delays in the procurement process and the government shutdown for 35 days from December 2|, 20l8 to January 25, 20l9. - The program ofﬁce and ITAC will need approximately three (3) months (July ~ September 2019) to prepare a procurement package and a solicitation, evaluate quotes and make a new BPA order award. In addition, the bridge task order will need an additional one or two months transition time including the DHS Entry on Duty (EOD) process, which can take between 30 to 180 days depending on the clearance level. Three (3) one-month option periods are included as a contingency plan and each option period will be exercised should it become a necessity. 0 DHS has a critical need to continue (311 services to support ongoing DHS missions such as the DHS Common Operating Picture (COP) at the National Operations Center (N 0C) and the Cyber Communications Operating Picture (COP) at the National Cyber Communication Integration Center (NCCIC). ArdentMC currently provides continuous GI] support serving geospatial enterprise services to DHS and mission partners. While other vendors may be able to provide these services, ArdentMC is the only vendor that has a specialized combination of geospatial knowledge and administration services, TS/SCI clearances, and a vendor offsite development and testing environment required to provide services prior to the award of the new BPAr if there is a lapse in services, DHS will not have critical geospatial data to help protect and secure the nation. A recent example of such activity were the collection, management, and sharing of geospatial data, ie road closures, egress routes, casualty collection points, etc. during the recent 2018 United Nations General Assembly and 2019 State of the Union Address. This activity proved critical to the United States Secret Service and its interagency partners ensuring that critical geospatial information was available to all Common Operating Pictures, both in the Multi—Agency Communication Center (MACC) and to ﬁeld agents utilizing the Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK). If a lapse of service were to occur during an event like this, national security would be weakened LSJNOJ FYl9-0154 1.2. Limited-Sources J ustiﬁeation (LSJ) 5 Determination by the ordering activity contracting ofﬁcer that the anticipated order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d). The Contracting Ofﬁcer has determined that awarding the proposed task order with ArdentMC represents the best value to the Government and will be fair and reasonable based on the vendor’s General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 70 contract #GS—35F—02l 2U. A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task order will be placed in accordance with FAR 8404, Use of Federal Supply Schedules. The GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable prices for the hourly labor rates on the vendor’s GSA schedule contract. Discounts to the GSA schedule rates will be requested. The contractor’s proposed FFP price quote will be compared to the GSA labor rates and the Independent Govemment Cost Estimate (IGCE) to ensure that the total price proposed is fair and reasonable for this effort. 6 A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results, or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted The reviewed results of market research conducted during the GTSS 20 EPA procurement, there is evidence that there are several companies that have similar technical capabilities such as ArdentMC. However, because of the government shutdown and delays in awarding GTSS 2.0 BPA, conducting a competitive procurement and ensuring any new personnel received Entry-On-Duty, clearances and priviledged network access would not have been achievable prior to the end of the current BPA Order. Therefore, ArdentMC is the only company that can perform the required services during the six-month period of March 30, 2019 - September 29, 2019, 7 Any other facts supporting the limited-sources justiﬁcation. There are no additional facts. 8 A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration (Lei, limited-sources) before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made. Future acquisitions for these services will be competed under the multiple~award GTSS 2.0 EPA that is currently being solicited, 9 DHS intends to post this requirement on chBizOpps pursuant to FAR 8,405-6(a)(2)(i). 10 Technical/Requirements Personnel Certiﬁcation.

Implementation ofgovemanoe activities in KP Attachment B Background As a result of the 18th Amendment to the Pakistani constitution in 2010, a key revenue source, the General Sales Tax on Services, was devolved to provinces, giving the provinces an opportunity to improve their own source revenue. However, to date, as a result of capacity constraints and lack of coordination and integration between the government entities responsible for revenue generation, the Government of Khyber Pakhnmkhwa (GoKP) has been unable to fully exploit the sources of revenue devolved to the province. This has resulted in limited fiscal space; in other words, the 6010‘ has limited ability to raise public spending in areas such as basic services provision and law enforcement capacity without undermining ﬁscal sustainability, According to the GoKP’s Budget Strategy Paper for 2019-20, 80 percent of the province’s budget is likely to be used for non—development purposes. Increasing space for development spending will require the government 11: improve revenue mobilization while reducing costs/expenditures. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province remains heavily dependent on ﬁscal transfers from the federal government. In ﬁscal year 2016-17, transfers from the federal government accounted for 95 percent of the provincial revenue, according to a ﬁnancial statement of the GoKP, Once dominated by agriculture, the provincial share of GDP is now dominated by the services sector (67 percent), followed by industry (20 percent) and agriculture (13 percent). A 2018 analysis by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Revenue Authority (KPRA) of the General Sales Tax on Services indicated that by improving tax compliance from an estimated 23 percent of eligible taxpayers to 75 percent of taxpayers, KP could triple its tax revenue and reduce its dependency on federal transfers. The merger of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with KP creates new challenges and opportunities for the province. While the newly merged districts of KP have been given a ﬁve-year tax exemption, going forward KP’s taxation system and development expenditures will extend to theregion. FATA was historically exempt ﬁom taxation and hence lacks basic infrastructure and systems to collect taxes. Given that FATA is one of the poorest regions of Pakistan, the merger will affect KP’s ﬁscal situation and increase the need for development ﬁnancing. In the interim, KP must improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of its domestic revenue mobilization capacity, while also preparing to gradually extend its systems to the newly merged districts aﬁer the tax exemption period. To address ﬁscal constraints, the GoKP’s Public Financial Management (PFM) Reform Strategy for 2017—2020 provides the strategic underpinning for the GoKP’s objective of strengthening the province’s PFM system in the short—to—medium term. The GoKP’s PFM strategy covers the whole PFM cycle at the provincial and local government levels. The strategy is organized around six policy objectives: (at) ensuring policy-driven planning and budgeting; (b) facilitating a comprehensive, credible, and transparent annual budget; (c) improving predictability and control in budget execution; (d) enabling resource Page 5 of 6 Request for Information (RF!) Implementation of governance activities in KP mobilization and enhancing provincial Own Source Revenue (OSR); (e) improving asset and liability management; and (t) fostering accountability for results. The strategy prioritizes increasing the province’s OSR and better allocation of existing resources to ﬁnance investments in infrastructure and public services, especially education, health, and water supply and sanitation. The proposed new USAID activity will support the GoKP in the implementation of the reform strategy objective “d” of enhancing OSR at the provincial level, which will also result in increased resources for local government. Ultimately, strengthening the GoKP’s ability to mobilize resources in pursuit of its development objectives will contribute to its Journey to Self-Reliance by increasing its capacity to assume an increasing amount of its development expenditures Page 6 of 6"}

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD SECTION M Evaluation Factors for Award M.1 Section M 1. Basis for Award. This is a best value source trade-off selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part l5, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the BIA Acquisition Regulation Supplement Instruction (DARSI). Award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value (see Far 2.101) in accordance with the evaluation criteria in Section M, Evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are signiﬁcantly more important than price in the award decision (FAR 15.101-1). 2. The Government will award to the best overall offer. based upon an integrated assessment of corporate security. technical/management capability, relevant past performance, small business participation, subcontracting plan for large businesses, and price. The Scientiﬁc Computing Operations, Analysis, and Applications (SCOAA) contract will be awarded to the Offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented. whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations. certiﬁcations. and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and isjudged, based on the evaluation factors and sub-factors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the Offeror who gives DlA the greatest conﬁdence that it will meet or exceed the requirements. This may result in an award to a higher rated and/or higher priced offer: for example where the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the non-price factor and sub-factor responses of the higher-price offer outweighs the cost difference. The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation. 3. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. The Government will select the best overall offer based on Corporate Security, Technical/Management Capability, Relevant Past Performance. Small Business Participation, and Subcontracting Plan for large businesses, and Price. Evaluation factors other than Price, when combined, are SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN Price in the award decision. 4. The Govemment may or may not establish a competitive range alter evaluating all proposals in accordance with FAR 15. If discussions are to be conducted, a competitive range will be established prior to the commencement of discussions. If discussions are to be conducted, the Contracting Ofﬁcer shall establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efﬁciency pursuant to FAR part 15. To be considered for award, each Offeror's proposal shall, at a minimum, across all Factors and Sub-factors, meet the requirements of the SOW, shall indicate an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and the proposal’s strengths and weaknesses shall be offsetting or have little or no impact on contract performance, therefore, indicating risk of unsuccessﬁil performance will be no worse than moderate. 5. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or to other than the Offeror with the highest technical score if the SSA determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government, However, the Government will not make an award at a signiﬁcantly higher overall cost to achieve slightly superior technical and management features. 6. Evaluation Factors and Subfactors The Government will use the following evaluation factors and Subfactors to evaluate each proposal. Award will be made to the Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and Subfactors described below. a.Factor l — Corporate Security (Pass/Fail) b.

Factor 3 — Relevant Past Performance d. Factor 4 , Small Business Participation e. Factor 5 — Subcontracting Plan f. Factor 6 — Supply Chain Risk (Pass/Fail) g. Factor 7 - Price 7. Corporate Security a. Each offer will be evaluated to determine that all Corporate Security requirements are met. This is a Pass/Fail factor. If the Offeror does not receive a Pass in the Corporate Security factor of the proposal, the proposal will not be evaluated further. b. The Government will evaluate the security Factor on a \"Pass/Fail\" basis. During evaluations ofeach proposal, the Government will assign a rating based on the rating table listed below and provide a written narrative supporting the evaluation as either Pass or Fail. Table 1 — Coﬂmrate Security Assessment Rating Ratin Narrative The prime Offeror, at the time of proposal submission, has a TOP SECRET facility clearance. The prime Offeror, at the time of proposal submission, DOES NOT have 3 TOP SECRET facili clearance. 8. Technical/Management Capability Factor Assessment a. The Offeror’s Technical/Management Capability will be ratedjointly with the risk associated with its technical solution. The technical and risk rating evaluates the quality of the Offeror’s technical expertise and solution for meeting the Government’s requirement. I Each technical & management capability Subfactor will receive one of the adjectival ratings described in Table 2, Combined Technical/Management Risk Ratings. The ratings will NOT be rolled up into a single Technical/Management Factor rating. 1). The combined technical/ risk rating includes consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths and weaknesses associated with an Offemr’s proposed approach and includes an assessment of the potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performancezthe need for increased Govemment oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performnn c. The rating depicts how well the Offeror’ s proposal meets the Solicitation requirements 0 A signiﬁcant strength is deﬁned as an aspect of the proposal that appreciably increases the likelihood of successful contract perfonnance. I A strength is deﬁned as an aspect of an Offeror’ s proposal that has merit or exceeds speciﬁed performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance > I A weakness is deﬁned as a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk ofu ’ uccessful contract performance \" o A signiﬁcant weakness is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. 0 A deﬁciency is deﬁned as a material failure of a proposal to meet the Government requirement or acombination of signiﬁcant wealmess in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. d.

The Offeror shall identify the corporate entity/element that supports this function along with their resources and expertise. 9 ) Subfactor 9 Recruitment: The Government will assess the Offeror’s proposal for determination of the Ot‘feror‘s depth and breadth of experience and ability to successfully recruit qualiﬁed personnel with the required clearances. The Government will differentiate proposals based upon how well the proposal describes the following (a) The Offeror’s recruitment program demonstrates their depth and breadth of experience and ability to successfully and consistently recruit personnel meeting the experience and qualiﬁcation requirements for labor category areas in the SOW and possess the security clearances and accesses necessary to comply with and perform the SOW in a timely and repetitive manner and the ability to meet surge requirements timely. (b) The Offeror provides complete information on the number of personnel possessing security clearances and the levels of those clearances by SOW labor category. (c) The Offeror clearly describes how they can meet 100% stafﬁng within the ﬁrst 30 days of a task order award, including facilities and their understanding of the BIA security clearance and adjudication process. 6. Each technical & management capability Subfactor will receive one of the adjectival ratings described in Table 2, Combined Technical/Management Risk Ratings. The ratings will NOT be rolled up into a single Technical/Management Factor rating. Table 2: Combined Technical/Management Risk Ratings Ratin Description Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses, Risk of unsuccessful erforrnance is very low. Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses, Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is hi . Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deﬁciencies and is not awardable. Proposals receiving unacceptable ratings will be eliminated from further consideration. 9. Past Performance Factor Assessment a. The past performance evaluation assesses the Offeror’s probability of meeting the solicitation requirements, The past performance evaluation considers each Offeror’s demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying services that meet the contract’s requirements b. Ratings. The past performance factor will receive one of the performance relevancy ratings described below in Table 3: Past Performance Effort Relevancy Determinations and one of the perfonnance conﬁdence assessments described below in Table 4: Performance Conﬁdence Assessment Ratings. c. Evaluation Process. The past performance evaluation considers the Offeror’s recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements. The Government may consider past performance in the aggregate, in addition to on an individual contract basis. In conducting the past performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the Offeror’s Past Performance proposal volume and information independently obtained from other Govemment sources such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Rating Systems (CPARS) and Past Performance lnformation Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and commercial sources. Adverse past performance records that are considered recent and relevant will be evaluated and included as part of the Conﬁdence Assessment. d. Recency Assessment. An evaluation of the past performance information will be made to determine if the Offeror and the prime Offeror’s teaming partners, joint ventures, and/or signiﬁcant subcontractors provided past performance information within three (3) years priorto proposal submission, or for ongoing efforts, if they were in place at least nine (9) months before the proposal due date. Past performance information that fails this condition will be assessed as “not meeting the recency requirement.” A teaming partner,joint venture and/or signiﬁcant subcontractor is considered to be a company that provides 20% or more of the support required, and/or a company that provides a critical portion of the effort required and/or that inﬂuences the results of performance. 6. Relevancy Assessment, The Government will assess the Offeror’s capability to perform task orders under the Scientiﬁc Computing Operations, Analysis, and Applications (SCOAA) contract by evaluating the past performance information, of either a prime contractor or a subcontractor, on previous or on-going contracts with similar scopes. Only relevant past performance efforts completed within the last three (3) years, prior to proposal submission, or for ongoing efforts will be evaluated. More relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more inﬂuence on the past performance conﬁdence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance All past performance efforts rated as “Non Relevant“ will not be evaluated for performance conﬁdence assessment, The lack of relevant past performance information will result in an “Unknown Conﬁdence” (Neutral) rating (Le, neither favorable nor unfavorable). in conducting relevancy determination, each reference shall be assigned one of the ratings in the table below. Table 3: Past Performance Effort Relevancy Determinations Degree Description Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same scope and Very Relevant (VR) mamitude of effort and complexities this solicitation remrires. Relevant (R) Past/present performance effort Involved Slmllal’ scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Somewhat Relevant Past/present performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude (SR) of effort and complexities this solicitation requires Past/present performance effort involved little or none of the scope and Not Relevant (NR) magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation recEires, f. Conﬁdence Assessment. The Government will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the performance conﬁdence assessment. The Government will review past performance in the areas of Quality, Schedule, Cost Control, Business Relations, and Management of Key Personnel. The Government may use additional information that is readily available to the Government including both the information received from Offerors, information contained in the Past Performance Questionnaires, and information obtained from other sources. During the evaluation of an Offeror’s past performance, the Government may query the Government agency references provided by the Offeror. Other sources may include interviews with program managers and contracting ofﬁcersr available DoD and other agency past performance databases and available data from previous source selections or contractor capability assessments. Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by Offerors in their proposals may be used to evaluate Offeror past performance. The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure problems it ﬁnds in proposals. The Offeror bears the burden of demonstrating the quality of its past performance. Offerors may be asked to respond to adverse past performance information In conducting a performance conﬁdence assessment, each Offeror shall be assigned one of the ratings in the table below. Table 4: Performance Conﬁdence Assessment Ratings Ratin Description Based on the Offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a hi h expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Ot’feror will successfullxperform the required effort. Based on the Offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfullmerform the required effort. Based on the Offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will successfully_perfonn the reqired effort. Unknown No recent/relevant performance record is available or the Offeror’s performance Conﬁdence record is so sparse that no meaningful conﬁdence assessment rating can be (Neutral) reasonably assigned. 10. Factor 4 - Small Business Participation a. The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s Small Business Participation Plan, in accordance with the adjectival basis as depicted in Table 5, below, by the Contracting Ofﬁcer and the Office of Small Business Programs for compliance with FAR Part 19.704, DFARS 2| 5.304. and DlA subcontracﬁng goals as Iimd in Section L. b. The Government will assess the Oﬂ‘eror’s proposal for determination of the Offeror’s existing or planned method to implement a robust use of initiatives for development of new sources of services required by this request for proposal and the initiative to identify and use small businesses such as Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Woman-Owned Small Businesses, HUBZonc businesses, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses which have the capabilities to satisfy requirements of this contract. c. This factor will be evaluated and rated according to Table 5 below: Table 5: Small Business Participation Assessment Ratings Ratin Description Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of requirements, Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low, Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deﬁciencies and is not awardable, 1]. Factor 5 — Subcontracting Plan (For other than U.S. Small Businesses ONLY. The subcontracting plan will not be Rated other than Present and Compliant! Present but Not Fully Compliant, or Not Present.) (1) Separate from the Small Business Participation Plan, other than US. Small Business offerors mm also submit a subcontracting plan meeting the requirements of FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252219-7003 (or DFARS 252.219-7004 ifﬂie offeror has a comprehensive subcontracting plan), Other than US. Small Businesses shall submit acceptable subcontracting plans to be eligible for award, Subcontracting Plans shall reﬂect and be consistent with the commitments offered in the Small Business Participation Plan. Plans that are Present but Not Fully Compliant will be provided an opportunity to correct deﬁciencies. 12. Supply Chain Risk Factor Assessment a. In accordance with DFARS 239.73 and DFARS PGI 215.304(c)(v), there will be a review ofthe supply chain including all information technology subcontractors and suppliers proposed. Each proposal must clearly identify teaming arrangements, proposed subcontractors and suppliers, and a risk management/mitigation plan, b. The Government will evaluate the supply chain risk Factor on a “Pass/Fail\" basis. During evaluations of each proposal, the Government will assign a rating based on the rating table listed below and provide a written narrative supporting the evaluation as either Pass or Fail, If the Offeror does not receive a Pass in the Supply Chain Risk factor of the proposal, the proposal will not be evaluated further and will not be eligible for award. Table 6 — Supply Chain Risk Rating Ratin Narrative The risk to the supgly chain is acceptable. The risk to the supply chain is unacceptable. 13.. Factor 7 — Price Factor Assessment a. The total evaluated price will be based on the information provided in the Labor Hour Category Pricing Excel spreadsheet provided as _ The total evaluated price will be derived by summing the total proposed Labor, total Travel ODC plug in amount, and total Material ODC plug in amount for the base five ordering years, the option ﬁve ordering years and 6 month option ordering period b. The total evaluated labor price will be calculated by multiplying each fully loaded blended labor rate proposed for each labor category and site location (On Government Site and Off-Government Site) by the estimated hours provided for each labor category and site location and then summin those amounts in the Labor Hour Category Pricing Excel spreadsheet provided as d for the bﬁe ﬁve ordering years, the option ﬁve ordering years and 6 month option ordering period. The estimated labor hours included in the solicitation are for evaluation purposes only and do not obligate the Government to award such labor hours. ct The total Travel CDC and Material ODC amounts will be calculated by adding the total proposed amounts for the total Travel ODC plug in amount, and total Material Pl in amount in the Labor Hour Category Pricing Excel spreadsheet provided as d for the base ﬁve ordering years. the option ﬁve ordering years and 6 month option ordering period. Evaluation of the option will not obligate the Government to exerise the option.

These areas enable MSIC to produce scientiﬁc anditechnical intelligence (S&Tl) assessments of foreign ground-based air defense missiles, ballisticmissiles, ballistic missile defense systems, anti-tank guided missiles, anti-satellite and directed ener' ,vveapons, as well as their associated command, control, communications, and computer (C4) systems. 1.1 Mission. MSIC’s Scientiﬁc Computing and Analysis Division will manage this contract vehicle. The division is responsible for developing, managing'and sustaining-acomputing infrastructure, a broad range of applications and analytical tools, andicore knowledge bases that enable 8&TI analysis and production It conducts computational analysis and weapon performance modeling and simulation to assess characteristics and performance of threat weapon systems using state-of- the-art laboratories and the High Performance Computing System (HPCS) that it maintains and operates as an IC asset. The division also directsportal operations and production wotkﬂow processes that enable digital production and dissemination of intelligence products. Working across the 1C and DoD community, it\"servesllas the Program Management Ofﬁce for DoD Equipmen Codes, ' 'tary Equipment Parametrics & Engineering Database (MEPED), and , ed Reprogramming Database (EWIRDB), which are vital, authoritative etrie data on various military equipment. Additionally, the division vanccd analytic and artiﬁcial intelligence techniques, processes, alyst efﬁciencies and productivity. 1.2 Background MSIC employs a comp rig infrastructure built with Windows workstations and servers and Linux servers on multiple secure networks, including the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JVVICS) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). The infrastructure facilitates the rapid development and deployment of applications, databases, and analytical tools required for conducting engineering assessments of foreign weapon systems. Daily operations entail hardware and software acquisition and integration, network maintenance and accreditation, system testing and patching, information assurance (IA), conﬁguration management, data transfer, and technology modernization. UNCLASSIFIED SOW Page 1 of 38 UNCLASSIFIED MSIC uses over 20 Model and Simulation (M&S) constructs to simulate performance, assess lethality, and identify vulnerabilities of weapon systems. M&S also entails development of analytical tools for software optimization andvisuaﬁzation, distributed simulation architecture and analysis, validation and veriﬁcation, documentation, and risk mitigation planning. Each M&S obtains the requisite IA and accreditation certiﬁcation prior to operating on MSIC networks. MSIC has produced and currently stores about six petabytes of data that is critical to its core knowledge of characteristics, performance and vulnerabilities of assigned foreign weapon systems. This base of data comprises engineering products, threat weapon models, intelligence source material, written assessments, extensive technical data ﬁles, and many other ﬁle and data types that must be analyzed, fused, and disseminated by the workf ’ ‘ [DoD customers. Multiple knowledge management databases support the auto—generat of 4,60 ' &Tl web pages seen by 1,000 DoD customers each day. DIA/MSIC supports DoD Intelligence Mission Data (IMD) requirements by EWIRDB, and DIA’s Military Modern Integrated Database», (MIDB) Defense (Intelligence Equipment Code (DIEQP) program. IMD is described by DMBD, Directive 5250.01 as DoD intelligence used for programming platform mission systems in development, testing, operations, and sustainment including, but not limited to, the ﬁanctional areas of Characteristics and Performance (C&P) data, Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) date, Order of Battle data, Signature data, and Geospatial Intelligence. MSIC operates and maintains a large-scale High Performance Computing System (HPCS) for both internal use and external use w‘ ‘ in the Intelligence Community to enable mission-critical and essential foundational analysis capabilities, The HPCS provides a robust, secure. and efﬁcient computing environment for developing and processing complex, specialized scientiﬁc applications.

Without this capability, operational in a personal computing desktop environment for use by Library staff, the Library is unable to produce digitized content in limited quantities that meets the technical requirements speciﬁed and enforced by the NDNP digital content management and preservation environment While other companies may publish document processing or image conversion software or offer conversion services, no other company incorporates NDNP-compliant speciﬁcations and validation processing into a desktop application. This is a sole source acquisition from its manufacturer, Content Conversion Specialists GmbH (CCS).

Identiﬁcation of the agency and contracting activity. ' The US. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Technology/Mission Support Contracts Unit, has prepared thisjustiﬁcation for other than full and open competition for annual ﬁxed licenses for online foreign language self—study programs, available to multiple users ' sequentially in multiple languages on behalf of the Language Professionals Training Unit (LP’I'U), Intelligence Workforce Development Section, Directorate of Intelligence. 2. The nature and/or description of the action being approved, i.e., sole source, limited competition, establishment of a new source, etc. The LPTU seeks to acquire Mango Languages Annual Subscription — License Offering for online foreign language self-study resources through the award of a sole source firm ﬁxed price contract The 1000 sequentially re-assignable licenses will be available to FBI users simultaneously in 70 + languages offered by Mango Languages. 3. A description of the-supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs. Mango Languages is a self-paced learning program that teaches language through relevant topical dialogues using four key components — vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, and culture. Mango Language’s unique methodology features content that empowers learners to comprehend, construct, and create conversations in the real world. The suite of products includes the following components: I) Mango Conversations — self-paced language learning soﬁware that helps users learn practical conversations and cultural insights to communicate effectively, 2) Mango Mobile - free applications for Android and iOS mobile devices that allow users to take their learning with them, with or without connection to the Internet, 3) Mango Auto Play 7 hands-free audio feature that allows users to learn on-the-go without the need for swiping, 4) Mango Premiere that provides effective language learning through ﬁlm, and 5) Mango Administrative Portal with real-time statistics and usage data that makes it easy to track learner progress and usage. Version 1.0 'ert Req Number) ’ Page 1 of 10 Requisition Number: The LPTU has a requirement to provide foreign language learning resources that offer desktop and mobile access to support on-the—go language learning. Mango‘ Languages meets the requirement of multi-platform access and content synchronization and of accessing the content hands-free without connection to the Internet (Auto-Play). The product is 508 compliant and runs on HTML 5 rather than Flash software. The goal is to purchase licenses for the Base Year with additional four Option Years for which funding is expected to be allocated in the subsequent Fiscal Years. The 1000 re-assignable licenses offer simultaneous desktop and mobile access to instruction in 70 + languages over the life of the licensing contract. The licenses are accessed directly through a vendor’s website, with no soﬁware downloaded on FBI computers. The procurement of Mango Languages licenses will allow the LPTU to fulﬁll its objective of providing support to FBI personnel who must have language skills in order to be effective at their jobs. It will make it possible for the LPTU to offer an effective self-study resource to FBI personnel who need to acquire a new language but do not qualify for training with an instructor, or who need to sustain foreign language skills between classroom training events. 4. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)(or 10 USC 2304(c) (1)) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302- Ientitled, “Only One Responsible Source and No‘Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.” 5. Demonstrate the unique qualiﬁcations of the proposed contractor or the nature of the action requiring the use of the authority. The LPTU’s market research has demonstrated that Mango Languages is uniquely qualiﬁed to meet the FLTP’s requirement of procuring state-of-the-art, online self-study resources to a dispersed and mobile population of FBI learners in 70 + languages for the listed price. Below _ are some of Mango Language’ 5 technical features that make the program uniquely qualiﬁed to meet the FBI’s needs: 0 Mango Language’s curriculum mirrors the needs of the learner at each proﬁciency level. The program offers language training based on real- life dialogues from the Beginner ‘ (ILR 0, 0+ 1), through Intermediate (ILR 1+) to Advanced levels (ILR 2, 2+ 3, 3+) of proﬁciency. I Mango Premiere offers language learning through ﬁlm, which makes learning exPer-ience authentic, motivating and fun. I Mango Language’ 5 methodology called Intuitive Language Construction is uniquely based on the latest research' 1n the ﬁeld of fore1g11 language learning. It is designed to simulate the way people lean-1 through practical conversation in an immersive environment, where through memory building exercises students intuitively apply what they have learned and develop ﬂuency. Requisition Number err Req Number) Version 1.0 Page 2 of 10 - Mango Language’s proprietary Semantic Color Mapping feature 8110st users to_ easily understand how the grammatical structure of their native language corresponds to that of their target language. 0 Unlike most of programs available on the market, Mango Languages integrates cultural insights into lessons, ensuring that users develop an understanding of the expectatiom, customs, and etiquette of the culture they are studying. - The mobile application provides an Auto Play feature designed to facilitate hands-ﬂee learning experience. I Once the user downloads the content, the mobile application does not require an Internet connection and it has the same core learning content and core learning features as the online program. 1 Mango Languages includes all languages critical to the FBI operations and national security, such as Arabic, Bosnian, Chinese Mandarin, Farsi, French, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Somali, Uzbek and others. a The course contents and student progress sync automatically between the platforms. The LPTU has not been able to identify any other vendor which can provide product and services of such quality at a comparable price. Berlitz offers online courses with an instructor that are supported by online ‘practice lessons’, which does not meet the FLTP’s requirement for autonomous learning. Berlitz also offers fewer languages (50 plus). The FluentU online courses are in nine languages only and the program is cost prohibitive. Babbel online program offers only 14 languages and only 5 are critical to the national security. The failure to procure Mango Languages to support the FBI Foreign Language Self-Study Program will result in: l) atrophying language skills of FBI personnel who must use foreign languages on thejob; 2) wasted FBI investment in personnel who obtained very expensive language training with an instructor and does not have access to adequate resources to sustain the language between allowable classroom training events; 3) preventing those personnel who need to develop language proﬁciency for their work, but who are ineligible for classroom training, or for whom LPTU cannot offer training due to lack of qualiﬁed in-house instructors or funding from acquiring, maintaining or enhancing their languageskills; 4) impeding FBI operations across the U.S. and the world, thus negatively impacting the FBI mission. 6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required ' by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. LPTU researched the market and in addition to Mango, researched six other companies that provided language services. The LPTU PM researched on—line the six companies to determine their product offerings. None of the six offered the full suite of languages that Mango offers with the app for Android and Apple 108 as well as the self-paced language learning soﬁware that helps users learn practical conversations and cultural insights to communicate effectively. This procurement is not classiﬁed and can be posted on FBO for a set period of time. Version l.0 Page 3 of 10 Requisition Number: (inter: Req Number) 7. The anticipated dollar value of the proposed acquisition, including options if applicable, and a determination by the Contracting Ofﬁcer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The FBI’s critical need is to provide resources to its personnel who need to sustain or acquire language skills through self-study in order to develop a cadre of language-enabled personnel. The anticipated dollar value of this acquisition is not to exceed $20,000 for the base contract year, with a 5% lifecycle anticipated cost for the four option years. 8. A description of the market research conducted and the results. In recent years, the demand for online foreign language resources and mobile applications to support the FBI autonomous learner requirement has grown exponentially. The LPTU‘s foreign language training subject matter experts have conducted Internet research and hands-on testing ‘ of several online Self-study soﬁware applications and mobile apps. Among reviewed products were Berlitz, FluenZ, FluentU, Babbel, Duolingo, and Rosetta Stone. In varying degrees, they all meet methodological and technical requirements. However, they do not meet the key language availability requirement described in section f‘Product/Service Description\". 0 Berlitz offers online courses with an instructor that are supported by online ‘practice lessons.’ Berlitz also offers fewer languages and licenses must be purchased for each individual learner and are cost prohibitive. FlueuZ online courses are offered in 7 languages only, no Arabic or its dialects. FluentU online offers courses in l 1 high density languages only; no Arabic or its dialects. Babbel online program offers only 12 languages and only 5 are critical to the national security; no Arabic or its dialects. Duolingo offers lessons in 23 languages; no Arabic dialects. Rosetta Stone' is offered in 22 languages only and does not include all languages needed to support the FBI operations The cost per license 15 prohibitive. Market research has demonstrated that Mango Languages is uniquely qualiﬁed to meet the FLTP’s requirement of procuring state—of-the—art, online and mobile self-study resources to a dispersed population of FBI learners in 70 + languages. It has been found that Mango Languages best meets the FBI’s requirements for multiple-language and course-level, multi-user, mobile-accessible foreign language leaming tools in languages that are critical to FBI operations, as well as those which are less commonly taught, but necessary to support FBI international engagements around the world. A wide range of languages offered by Mango Languages addresses the FLTP’s requirement to procure self-study resources when there are no FBI on— board linguists/instructors or vendor school instructors available to teach a language, e.g. Punjabi, Romanian, Pashto, Polish, Tamil, Urdu and other low-density languages. Market research has also indicated an exceptionally adventitious cost/beneﬁt compared to other available online language programs. The licenses can be assigned sequentially and are accessed directly through a vendor’s website, with no soﬁware downloaded on FBI or home computers. The procurement of these licenses will make it possible for the FLTP to offer ah effective self— study resources to FBI personnel who need to acquire a new language, but cannot be offered Requisition Number: (insert Req Number) Version [.0 Page 4 of 10 training with an instructor, or who need to sustain foreign language skills between classroom training events. 9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. The acquisition of Mango Languages will enable learning and sustaining foreign languages by FBI employees who 1) do not qualify for classroom training, 2) whose work schedule prevents them from unending regular classes, 3) whose life and job obligations permit the development of their language skills “on-the-go” only, or 4) who are in-between allowable classroom training events (due to funding restrictions) and need to prevent their language skills from atrophying. Failure to acquire Mango Languages licenses in 70 + languages will limit the number of FBI employees to whom LPTU can provide self-study resources. It will harm Legat personnel and their families, who rely on foreign language self-study resources both before deployment and while in-country, to whom classroom training, as well as more popular FLRC self-study resources cannot be provided due to their limited availability. It should be mentioned that Mango Languages is a well-recognized soﬁware utilized by several Intelligence Community and DOD agencies, such as CIA, NRO, Department of Homeland Security, Department of State’s Foreign Service Institute (F SI) and many more to train their personnel. 10. A listing of any sources that expressed a written interest in the acquisition. Since the procurement has not been advertised, no other companies have expressed an interest either orally or in writing. 11. A statement of any actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition, if subsequent acquisitions are anticipated. The LPTU foreign language training experts will continue to conduct market research to maintain awareness of new online foreign language self-study. products that might become available.

The methods employed for this task were developed over the course of a spectrum-by-spectrum review of a library containing well over 100,000 spectra, Although the effectiveness of this quality improvement task depended critically on the expertise of the evaluators, a number of guidelines are discussed which were found to be effective in performing this onerous and often subjective task. A number of specific examples of the particularly challenging task of spectrum editing are given.

For instance, complex ions can disso— ciate through a series of consecutive and competitive pathways, often allowing multiple paths to a single observed ioni Furthermore, these ions may rearrange before dissociation, so that an observed fragment ion may not be assigned with confidence to a distinct structural unit in the original molecule. Another prob lem is that relative peak abundances depend on differ ences in dissociation rates that cannot be predicted to a useful level of accuracy For these reasons, mass spectra cannot be reliably predicted, and spectra of compounds to be identified (“unknowns”) are often treated simply as molecular fingerprints, for which compounds having similar spec? tra in a reference library are found in a \"library search” and arranged in order of similarity to the unknown I )rediction of the electron-ionization mass spec- Address reprint requests to S.

These systems are now widely available as an integral part of mass spectrometer data systems. The largest collections [1, 2] are composed of spectra origi- nating from a variety of sources, including donations, purchases, or acquisition from the literature. This diver- sity of sources inevitably means that the spectra will be of variable quality, even when the nominal instrument operating conditions (7UeeV electrons, for example) are the same. While at one time it was hoped that computer methods might be able to play a central role in spectral quality control [4—6], serious defects in this approach were pointed out by Domokos et a]. [7], and the inability of these methods to detect certain classes of Received October 5, 1998 Revised December 8, 1998 Accepted December 8, 1998 288 AUSLOOS ET AL. serious errors recognizable by experts was documented by Zhu et a1. [8], Other studies demonstrated the inadequacy of automated methods for selecting the best of replicate spectra for the same compound [9]. Conse- quently, about 10 years ago a manual evaluation effort was begun with the objective of removing significant, identifiable errors from the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library. A comparative discussion of ap- proaches for quality measurement and control efforts in two comprehensive libraries appeared shortly after this evaluation program began [10, 11]. The principal pur- pose of the present paper is to document the methods developed and applied for this large-scale evaluation project, leading to a partially evaluated version of the Library in 1992 and to a fully evaluated version in Ianuary of 1998 (NIST 98). Earlier versions of this library were released under the names NBS/EPA/ MSDC Mass Spectral Database (1988), and, originally, the EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Database (1978). Each of the 129,136 electron~ionization mass spectra in NIST 98 has been evaluated according to the methods described here, by team of mass spectrometrists who are knowl- edgeable about ionic fragmentation processes. A large literature describes ion fragmentation processes [12], which will not be specifically covered in this article. The need for such an evaluation has become increas- ingly evident as the fraction of GC/MS analysts with expertise in the application of the rules of mass spectral fragmentation has declined, partly as a result of the increasingly routine use of GC/MS. With this trend, deficiencies in library spectra are less likely to be detected by the analyst, a trend likely to continue with an increasing reliance on automated chemical identifi— cation methods. ln addition to the obvious benefit to users of having higher quality reference spectra to match their spectra, a knowledge that each spectrum has been accepted by an evaluator is expected to generally enhance the confidence in results obtained by library searching. Discussion Sources of New Spectra NlST 98 has 129,136 electron-ionization mass spectra of 107,886 compounds, derived from a larger collection of 175,510 spectra. The previous version (1992) of the NIST/ EPA / NIH Mass Spectral library contained some 75,000 spectra of 62,350 compounds; the new release contains 55,000 additional spectra. These come primar— ily from other spectral collections and spectra deter- mined specifically for the library, Other collections that have been incorporated into NlST 98, most with a specialized focus, are given in Table 1. Spectra determined especially for the library at NIST (3110 spectra) and at NIH (9510 spectra) provided another important source of new data for NIST 98. This dedicated effort, begun eight years ago, has as its goal the determination of spectra of ”useful” compounds not i J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 1999, 10, 2877299 Table 1, Data collections incorporated into NlST 98 It spectra Chemical Conceptsa 31,613 ASES/MS Database, Dalian Instituteb 4789 TNO Volatile Compounds in Foodc 1233 Georgiad and Virginia“ Crime Laboratories 1091 AAFS Toxicology Section, Drug Libraryf 835 VERIFINg and CBDCOMh Chemical Weapons 545 Association of Official Racing Chemistsi 186 St, Louis University Metabolic Disease‘ 131 2‘Chernical Concepts Quality Collection, Chemical Concepts GmbH, Weinheim, Germany (composed primarily of Professor Dieter Hen, neberg’s industrial chemical collection). ”Library contained in the Automated Structure Elucidation System, Dalian, China, C2nd ed., TNO Food Research, Zeist, NL, 1996, dPatti Price, Georgia Bureau of investigation, Decatur.

Measurements at NIST were devoted primarily to com- mercially available compounds and those measured at NIH were for compounds of significance to medicinal chemistry, A practical measure of the significance of specific compounds was its presence in other indexes of compounds (Table 2). Other sources of significant compounds were simply the catalogues of the major commercial suppliers of chemicals. The eventual goal is to obtain as many spectra as possible for compounds on these lists, For a compound on multiple lists, the goal is to acquire at least two independent spectra to further assure accu- racy for these more significant compounds, Few spectra were added from the largest source of available mass spectral information, the scientific liter- ature. The vast majority of these spectra include a small number of peaks selected by the author to confirm the identity of a newly synthesized compound. In addition to the generally low significance of the compounds, these partial spectra contain insufficient information for compound identification by spectrum matching. Evaluation Background As long ago as 1971, when Klaus Biemann and co- workers [13] published a pioneering paper on computer searching of mass spectral collections, it was pointed out that, for maximum effectiveness in matching spec tra of unknown compounds, comprehensive computer- J Am Soc Mass Spcch'om 1999, 10, 2877299 CRITICAI EVALUATION OF MS\" LIBRARY 289 Table 2.

Given the large size and heterogeneity of current comprehensive mass spectral libraries, insuring the quality of each spectrum in the collection is a major challenge. In 1988, after articles [7, 8] appeared in the literature pointing out errors in the version of the NIST library then available, the quality control procedures in use at that time were examined in detail [9]. The pre»1988 library was built of spectra, each of a unique compound, which were selected by computer from a larger archival collection in a fully automated selection process Fach spectrum selected had to be associated with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN); for every unique CASRN in the archive, one spectrum appeared in the library, regard— less of its quality. When there were two or more spectra of the same compound, the computerized selection process was based on a so—callcd “Quality Index,” an algorithm designed to detect errors in mass spectra, initially proposed and implemented by Speck, Venkat~ araghavan, and McLafferty [4], in 1978. A modified Quality Index was adopted for quality control of the EPA/ NIH Mass Spectral Data Base (the forerunner of the current NIST library) [5, 6]. The algorithm, among other things, checked for obvious errors such as peaks above the highest permissible molecular ion peak, and penalized spectra for having ”illogical” neutral losses or too few peaks. The value of the Quality Index was provided with each spectrum, with the expectation that a poor or erroneous spectrum would be recognized by library users through its low numerical grade. In 1988, the effectiveness of the Quality Index for selecting the best spectrum among several \"replicate\" spectra for a single compound was tested. After it was demonstrated that the Quality Index selected the better or best among replicates [9] only 5 % of the time, the onerous task of evaluating each and every mass spec» trum (as well as compound name, and structure) in the NIST collection was initiated This action was obviously necessary, not only for selecting the best of among replicate spectra, but even more, for finding serious errors in spectra and taking corrective action (deletion or editing). The fundamental problem with the use of a Quality Index approach to quality control was the inability to apply fragmentation rules other than those based solely on chemical formula. Chemical Structures Knowledge of the chemical structure of a compound is, of course, a prerequisite for the evaluation of its mass spectrum. At the start of the evaluation process, chem- ical structural drawings were available only for com- pounds that appeared in the 1978—1982 versions of the library, and these were inconveniently located in a multivolume collection of books [14]. Therefore, an effort was made to obtain digital representations of chemical structures for all compounds in the library. The building of an auxiliary collection of molecular structure information began with the conversion to two-dimensional drawings of approximately 32,000 \"connection tables” that had been used in an earlier on-line version of the library [15], The remainder of the structures was either acquired along with the spectra of the compound, or drawn by structure—entry personnel with the assistance of nomenclature experts. Structures were drawn using commercial drawing software and converted to a format compatible with NIST chemical structure analysis software. The availability of these chemical structures had many benefits for the evaluation process. For example, because the files could be organized and searched by structure, certain tasks could be automated: (1) Chemical ”registration” by structure, rather than Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN), allowed dropping the requirement that each compound to appear in the library must be associated with a CASRN. This permitted the inclusion of good quality spectra for thousands of additional compounds, (2) With the assistance of structure-matching soft- ware, it became possible to readily identify replicate spectra not associated with a CASRN, thereby facilitat- ing the examination of replicates with the goal of selecting the ”best” spectrum among those available. 290 AUSLOOS ET AL. (3) Spectra for stereoisomers having different CASRNs could be identified by computer methods and compared by evaluators. Stereoisomers often possess nearly identical mass spectra. Certain types of errors, especially those in names and formulas, could be located using the structure files: (1) With the addition of structural information to the archival files, checking the consistency between for- mula, molecular weight, chemical structure, and chem- ical name became an important means of detecting errors in the chemical identification information. in this way, many hundreds of errors in these auxiliary data associated with the spectra have been found and cor» rected. (2) Compounds with structures that could not be drawn because of problems with the names provided (ambiguous, “impossible,” or unrecognizable trivial names) were discovered, leading to the removal of the spectra for such ill—characterized compounds from the archival collection. The existence of the complete file of chemical struc- tures allows the use of a wide range of chemical processing software for the purpose of substructure identification and substructure searching. Finally, because the structural drawings were avail— able in a computer format, they could be displayed in computer versions of the library distributed to the public. Library users most often find that a display of chemical structures is far easier to interpret than a list of names, particularly when dealing with complex organic compounds. Chemical Names The primary identifier of the compound associated with a spectrum is the chemical name as provided by the laboratory that determined the spectrum. The structure drawings are based upon these names. Understandably, for a library built up over so many decades, and with spectra originating from so many sources, the names assigned to the subject compounds are not systematic, and include common names, commercial names, IUPAC names, Chemical Abstracts names, and many other variations. When carrying out a search of the library by chemical name, there is no way to know which of the many variations on a particular name may or may not appear in the “Names” file of the library. For the most common compounds, almost any recognizable name will suffice for a search (eg, the spectrum of methane can be retrieved by entering “marsh gas”), but for less common compounds there is a high probability that only a single name—that provided with the spec- trum when it was originally added to the libraryﬁwill be found At the time the library was managed by EPA, an attempt was made to collect as many alternative names as possible for compounds This policy has been con- tinued at N [ST, although to date no dedicated effort has been made to provide internally consistent, systematic I Am Soc Mass Spectrom 1999, lo, 287—299 names for all compounds. Some effort has been ex- pended on selecting the best (most readily recogniz- able) name for compounds with multiple names, al— though this task is not yet complete Also, for salts which yield spectra of the corresponding “free-base” under electron ionization, efforts have been made to change the original name (and CASRN) to that of the “free-base” compound. All names provided with the library are maintained in a separate database in which each name is associated with a CASRN or spectrum identification number (when a CASRN is unavailable) as well as a chemical formula. Errors in CASRNs were identified by a mis- match in the CAS checksum value and by inconsistency with the chemical formula associated with that CASRN in NIST internal files. Use of this library ensures that each replicate spectrum will be associated with the same chemical identification information. Evaluation of the NIST Mass Spectral Library Because effective computer methods for finding incon~ sistencies between the mass spectrum and structure of a compound are not available, evaluation was done in the traditional manner, with experienced mass SPeCtl’Ul‘i’k etrists examining each spectrum. The task was facili— tated using automated procedures designed to locate spectra containing possible errors, to compute individ ual quality index factors for a spectrum, and to locate similar spectra. However, all actual decisions to retain, edit, or delete a spectrum have been based on detailed evaluations by scientists. Of the eight full-time or part time evaluators who have worked on this project since l988, the names of six appear among the list of authors of this article (Ausloos, Clifton, Lias, Mikaya, Zaikin, and Zhu). Others associated with the evaluation early on were Stephen Down (Royal Society of Chemistry, and later Downstream Data, in England), and H. Zohdi of the University of Cairo. The evaluation procedure described below draws extensively on their experience. The evaluation procedure was designed to be as objective as possible and to concentrate on a detailed examination of each individual spectrum as well as on the collection of replicate spectra when available To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of any similarly structured program to critically evaluate mass spectral libraries Because of the unavoidable subjectivity in deciding whether a spectrum was of sufficient quality for inclue sion in the library, procedurally it was decided that the decision to reject or edit a spectrum must be agreed upon by two evaluators. In the event of a disagreement about a particular spectrum, the evaluators communie cate their reasoning to one another and attempt to reach a consensus. Disagreements usually involve defective spectra, and most often derive from a difference in strictness of judgment about what should or should not be retained in the library rather than a difference of scientific opinion about the details of the spectrum.

The original spectrum, shown on the bottom, had a large peak at Wz 43. This did not corre— spond to a fragment that logically could be formed by the compound. Peaks below W2 50 were re— moved after comparisons to related compounds indicated that these peaks were likely to arise from con- taminants. The evaluation was carried out using an evaluation \"form\" consisting of a printout of the spectrum which includes both a graphic and a text representation, as well as a structural drawing. The evaluator identifies the major (and often the minor) peaks in terms of fragmentation processes, and recommends an action: Accept, Flag (as low quality or redundant), Delete or Edit. When there is a problem, a discussion is written on the page, which can then be considered by a second evaluator. When two evaluators have agreed upon an action, this action is recorded in the master copy of the archive. The archive editing program automatically creates a permanent \"log\" of all edits and/or deletions carried out. The spectrum evaluation and library restructuring program was accomplished in four distinct phases: Preliminary cleanup: The objective of this initial phase was to find and correct or delete seriously ﬂawed spectra suffering from errors that could be identified by computer methods. The most common error found in the preliminary cleanup was that many chemical for— mulas were found to disagree with the listed molecular weight for the compound, apparently because of a computer error at some time in the past which trun- cated many chemical formulas. For new spectra. mo— lecular weights are now calculated from the formula, so such discrepancies can no longer occur. Other problems dealt with at this stage were spectra in which water or air peaks were predominant; these were identi— fied by a computer search, and, where possible, the peaks (or portions of peaks) due to water or air were subtracted from the spectrum after an evaluator first ensured that the targeted peaks were indeed due to these impurities. A number of spectra with major peaks at higher m/z than the molecular ion were also identi- fied by computer. This generally led to either the dis— covery of a molecular weight and/or formula error or deletion of the spectrum. Evaluation of replicate spectra: After the prelimi— nary cleanup was completed in 1989, evaluation of all replicate spectra was undertaken as the next major task, mainly because of the need to decide which would be included in the distributed library (the Quality Index calculation was incapable of performing this task). Although fewer than 20 % of the compounds in the library had replicate spectra, the importance of this subset of compounds, coupled with the added reliabil- ity due to having confirmatory spectra, ensured that this evaluation effort would noticeably enhance the overall quality of spectra in the library for average us- ers. As this phase of evaluation proceeded, a decision was made to change the policy of releasing only one spectrum per compound, and to provide, along with the main library, a separate replicate spectrum file that 292 AUSLOOS ET AL I Am Soc Mass Spectrom 1999, 10. 287499 too. 0’ 212 Mi‘ .ogrm ‘ + 2 [M—15] 59, 0 0H 19?

The spectrum of the non-brominated analog was subtracted and re—scaled. leaving a corrected spectrum of the compound, shown on the bottom. contained a limited number of good quality spectra for compounds already represented in the main library, This change in policy was made for the following rea« sons: (1) it was learned that certain spectral search- ing/matching algorithms used in commercial instru- ments gave significantly better results if replicates were included in the library; (2) replicate spectra have some value for documenting typical variations in mass spec tra for common compounds; (3) in a few instances, significant variations in the spectrum of a compound can occur because of different degrees of decompose tion in the mass spectrometer chamber. This file, called the ”Selected Replicates Library\", contained approximately 12,000 spectra of 8,000 compounds and was distributed for the first time with the 1992 edition of the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Database. Repre« sented in this release were spectra for 62,350 com« pounds. Efforts were made to restrict the number of replicates to two, although additional replicates were accepted when they were sufficiently unique. Evaluation of spectra without replicates. This task was inherently more difficult than evaluation of spectra with replicates. In several thousand cases, however, stereoisomers could be compared and replicate spectra could be found for comparison in other collections. Evaluation of newly acquired spectra. While the evaluation of the original archive was proceeding, sig— nificant numbers of new spectra were acquired. The evaluation of these spectra then became a major hurdle to the production of the new library. A particularly time consuming task was the evaluation of new repli- cate spectra, since each of these had to be compared to all previous spectra of the compound, and in some cases dozens of such replicates were in the archive. Because of the magnitude of this task and since nearly five years had passed since the previous release, it was decided to delay the full evaluation of a large subset of the new non-replicate spectra because these had been evaluated previously by other groups. These spectra, however, were subjected to the computer tests em— ployed for all other spectra and the suspect spectra were individually examined. The 1998 archive con— tained over 177,510 spectra, nearly triple the size of the 1988 archive. Except for the preliminary cleanup, which involved selectively removing several thousand exact duplicate copies of spectra, as well as locating spectra with the most egregious errors, the actual evaluation procedures carried out during the various phases were the same and are discussed together in the next section.

The original spectrum, shown on the bottom, contained peaks at 207 and 281 that had large isotope peaks that are characteristic of impurities from “column bleed” (ions containing Si). These peaks, which could not be explained in terms of the structure of the subject compound, were removed: the corrected spectrum is shown on the top. The possible bleed peak at 73 was unedited since a portion of it may have arisen from the compound under study. Evaluation Procedures and Criteria for Editing/ Deleting Spectra The primary criterion for inclusion of a spectrum in the library is that it has been verified that the spectrum is consistent with the structure of the subject molecule, and contains its most characteristic peaks. The evalua- tion of each individual (or replicate) spectrum includes the following overlapping steps. (1) Examination of the assigned name, structural drawing, and the spectrum itself to ensure that they are consistent Inconsistencies at this stage are most often due to an error in the structural drawing, and are corrected by redrawing the structure. In some cases, this may mean that the formula and molecular weight must be corrected to conform to the name provided by the original contributor of the spectrum. (2) Obvious problems not related to fragmentation mechanisms are also identified. These include: (A) lncomplcteness: Spectra reported in the literature gen— erally include only the major peaks, and hence are often incomplete. Since such spectra are not particularly useful for library searches, the policy has been adopted to include such spectra only if the compound is of special interest (see discussion above under ”Sources of New Spectra”) and no other spectrum is available. It is a long—term objective to replace each incomplete spec- trum with a complete spectrum determined especially for the library. (B) Correctness of the isotope ratios for the molecular ion and major fragments: This is done with the help of a NIST-developed program for predicta ing isotope peaks, which has been incorporated in the library maintenance program. Except for cases of clear instrument or transcription error, isotope peaks for the molecular ion are not added. Except in such narrowly defined instances, peaks are never added in the evalu» ation process. (C) Detector saturation: This is most reliably determined, when possible, by an examination of the abundances of the isotope peaks associated with the base peak. In a saturated spectrum, these isotope peaks will be too large. In cases where an isotope peak in a saturated spectrum can be unambiguously attrib uted to a particular ion, it is possible to correct the spectrum by increasing the abundance of saturated peaks relative to other peaks in the spectrum by the appropriate amount. (3) Ascertain whether the major peaks are reasonable for the particular molecular structure. This step may involve many operations. (A) Obviously, one starts by examining the peak due to the molecular ion (if there is one) to verify that it appears at the correct mass. (B) The evaluator then examines other peaks in the spectrum and verifies that they are reasonable for the particular 294 AUSLOOS ET AL.

The original spectrum, shown on the bottom, exhibited iarge peaks one and two units above the parent peak with abundances that did not correspond to the predicted abundances of the isotope peaks. Their presence was due to \"chemical ionization\" effects (proton transfer in the ion source) and the abundances were reduced to conform to correct values for the isotope peaks. The corrected spectrum is shown on top. molecular structure assigned to the compound. In this phase, all available spectra of the particular compound are examined, including (if any) all spectra for the compound in the NIST data archive, and also those in other mass spectral collections, especially the Wiley Registry of Mass Spectra [2]. (The Wiley Registry of Mass Spectra actually has some 36,847 spectra in com— mon with the NIST library because both incorporated spectra from older collections) Comparisons may also include spectra of stereoisomers, other isomers, homo» logues, derivatives, etc. The evaluator must have an in-depth knowledge of established rules of fragmentation [12]; ultimately, all decisions are based on the evaluator’s expertise (Even an agreement between a spectrum and its replicate spectra or spectra of stereoisomers does not guarantee that the spectrum will be accepted; in several instances, it was found that a number of similar spectra were bad in the same way.) Of course, in many instances, there are no other spectra with which a spectrum can be compared, and the evaluator must simply assess the validity of a spectrum wholly from a knowledge of the molecular structure and fragmentation rules. When the features of a spectrum are found to be reasonable for the particular molecular structure, then the spectrum is accepted for the library. If the library contains two or more correct spectra of a compound, one is chosen for the main library and the other(s) selected for the replicates ﬁle. Under certain conditions, certain types of low quality spectra may be included. For example, an incomplete spectrum may be included if no higher quality spectrum of the subject compound is available, and at least 10 of the most characteristic peaks are present. Similarly, ”monoisotopic” spectra (spectra of compounds where no isotopic peaks were recorded) may be included, but only if no better quality spectrum of the subject compound is available or can be obtained. In cases where corrections could be reliably made, spectral editing was done. Merely flagging these spectra would have relatively little benefit to users who depend on library searching to identify compounds. The major categories of correctable errors are: (1) Peaks due to impurities: the most common cor- rectable error is the presence of peaks from a foreign compound or compounds. This may result when mate— rial From the chromatographic column ”bleeds” (so- called ”column bleed”), when compounds previously determined in the mass spectrometer have saturated the walls of the inlet or the ionization chamber (“memory effects,” Figure 1), or—particularly in the case of older spectra determined before analytical instruments were commonly coupled to chromatographic columns? spectra of samples containing impurities.

The original spectrum (bottom) had significant peaks at masses 184 and 185, with the peak at 185 predominating. Expected neutral losses from this molecule would be 52(32) and H5263), which should lead to the observation of fragment ions at masses 183 and 18-1. Since there was no logical way to explain the loss of a fragment of mass 31, the cluster of peaks was shifted one mass unit lower. This is a transcription error. The corrected spectrum is shown on top. portions of peaks) from impurities can be subtracted from the spectrum provided the identity of the impurity compound can be established (Figure 2) or (in the case of column bleed) a reasonably reproducible pattern for the impurity peaks can be determined (Figure 3), Searches of the archive for spectra containing spectra of common solvents (benzene, methylene chloride, etc.) revealed dozens impure spectra which were either corrected or deleted, (2) “Chemical Ionization” effects: when a spectrum has been determined under conditions such that the ions in the chamber undergo collisions with neutral molecules before being detected, it is possible in certain compounds that ion/ molecule reactions such as proton transfer from an ionized molecule to a neutral molecule may occur. In this case, the abundance of the peak one unit higher than the parent ion peak (the “parent plus one”) will be significantly elevated above that of the expected isotope peak at that position. (In the event that the parent peak is the base peak, the evaluator must be able to distinguish between this effect and detector saturation; this distinction can sometimes be made by an examination of the abundance of the \"parent plus two” peak.) Since protonated molecules (”chemical ionization spectra\") typically do not undergo extensive dissociation, the assumption can be made that the occurrence of chemical ionization has not significantly altered the body of the spectrum, and the abundance of the \"parent plus one\" peak can simply be corrected. An example of a spectrum corrected for this effect is shown in Figure 4. (3) Transcription errors: some spectra were found to have one or more peaks that were displaced from their logical or expected position by one unit. This kind of error is most common among old spectra determined before mass spectrometers were computerized; opera- tors visually transcribing spectra ”by hand” sometimes made mistakes in correctly identifying the locations of peaks (Figure 5). in other preautomation spectra, the abundances of certain peaks were transcribed incor— rectly by a factor of 10 (Figure 6). In the event that such errors can be unambiguously identified, they are cor- rected. (4) Detector saturation: as discussed above, a spec- trum displaying detector saturation can be adjusted, provided that isotope peaks associated with a saturated peak can be unambiguously identified. (When this is not possible, spectra which show clear evidence of detector saturation are deleted, or labeled as poor spectra, depending on the extent of the problem.) (5) Spurious peaks: occasionally peaks appear in spectra because of instrument noise. Such peaks can sometimes be recognized because they would represent 296 AUSLOOS ET AL.

The fragment ion retains the bromine atom, so the abundances of these two peaks should exhibit the 1:1 ratio of the two major bromine isotopes. The abundance of the peak at m/z 168 is one tenth of that at m/z 170. An examination of the spectrum of a chloi'ineesubstituted analogue confirms that it is the m/z 168 peak that should be corrected upward, rather than the 170 peak being corrected downward. The abundance of the peak at m/z 168 was adjusted to the appropriate value. (The spectrum is indeed an old spectrum, probably transcribed \"by hand\") ”illogical” losses, and have no associated isotope peaks (Figure 7). Such peaks are simply deleted. (6) Errors in auxiliary data: as discussed above, the library contained numerous spectra with errors in the auxiliary identifying information (compound formula, molecular weight, CASRN). When the spectrum was found to be consistent with the name provided by the original laboratory, that name was taken as the primary identifier, and other information was corrected to con~ form. Occasionally (as pointed out in the literature by an author who later became one of the evaluators of the library [8]), the spectrum itself becomes the primary identifier, and it is the name (and other information), or sometimes the structural drawing (Figure 8), which must be corrected Generic Problems and Evaluation Policies Since a mass spectrum originates from a distinct gas phase compound, it is this precursor compound which is given as the source of each spectrum. Problems can arise, however, when the gas phase compound is not identical to the starting condensed phase sample, Such problems most often occur because of low volatility, reactivity or impurities in the sample. These problems are minimized when spectra are obtained by GC/MS, since only volatile substances can elute from the column and impurities are generally separated. Any decomposition prior to detection is usually revealed in the chromatogram. Decomposition in the injector, for instance, often generates complex mixtures while de‘ composition in the column leads to characteristic broad peaks. Certain organic salts are an exception. In some cases these are converted to covalent (free-base) forms prior to vaporization. For instance, good quality spectra of amines may be produced by quaternary ammonium salts such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, etc. The chemical names and CASRN of the free-base forms of these compounds are associated with these spectra, which generally differ from labeling of the precursor sample. Other types of onium salts may isomerize into covalent adducts with molecular weights equal to that of the cation and anion pairs. Such spectra are rejected. In addition, certain compounds may undergo chemical isomerization prior to injection or in the injector itself. It is the responsibility of the evaluator to detect such problems and, when appropriate, reject the resulting spectra. Problems arising from low sample volatility are particularly common for direct analysis (probe) mea— ] Am Soc Mass Spectrom 1999, 10, 2877299 CRITICAL EVALUATION OF MS LIBRARY 297 we /——\\ 195 210 59. 181 155 152 77 91 115 123 143 H H l I 39 51 103 e ,,...,Z.T,,,.,,,i,1 $7,613“, if? lil95.,.-,1-..,.,..l4, ill1.,,.',',‘l' ,il!l~,,,1.,.!‘iﬁ,w , A 2a 39 lie so so To 89 so me 119 120 130 1'40 159 169 in; 130 130 203 216 100 195 210 232 l 50 181 165 152 r? 91 115 129 1113 H H l y 39 51 103 a , 27., ,. 1, .i 113% 1,196.11.

This peak had no isotope peak and did not correspond to a logical loss. It was removed as a noise spike. surements, since with sufficient heating virtually any organic substance will give rise to volatile products For spectra taken with a probe, five varieties of problems are common: (1) Salts: when it is clear to the evaluator that the gas phase compound whose spectrum was determined was the freebase, rather than the precursor salt, peaks clearly originating from the anion portion of the salt are removed and the spectrum is assigned to the free-base compound (For example, a spectrum of a compound nominally labeled as a quaternary ammonium hydroa chloride will usually exhibit a good amine spectrum with a spectrum of HCl superimposed; the peaks orig- inating from HCl are subtracted, and the spectrum is labeled as a spectrum of the amine.) If decomposition is indicated or there is no stable form of the free-base compound, the spectrum is rejected. One goal for the immediate future is to recheck all spectra attributed to salts, to ensure that the spectra have been treated in a consistent manner by different evaluators, (2) Low volatility: for compounds of very low vola- tility, peaks in the vicinity of the molecular ion peak are generally required to confirm that the compound has vaporized without significant decomposition. (3) Reactivity: because of their combined reactivity and low volatility, certain classes of compounds tend to thermally degrade prior to volatilization. Examples are polyfunctional amines, amides, carboxylic acids, and polyols. However, in some cases good quality spectra unobtainable by GC/MS may be acquired by probe methods, and these are of value for LCMS analysis. Accepting or rejecting such spectra requires expert judgment of the evaluator (4) Volatile impurities: relatively volatile impurities, especially solvents used to dissolve samples for probe analysis, are common sources of spurious peaks in probe spectra. (5) Background subtraction: efforts to remove impu- rities by subtracting a region thought to contain impua rities from the target compound region can lead to significant distortion if the region subtracted actually contains a signiﬁcant contribution from the target com- pound. One problem inherent in all conventional El mass spectrometry is the decomposition of gas phase com- pounds in the mass spectrometer inlet or ionization chamberi Since mass spectra of thermal decomposition products often resemble fragmentation products of the precursor ion, this problem can be very difficult to detect. Adding to the problem is the variability of spectra arising from decomposition products, which can be sensitive to surface conditions Our general policy was to accept such spectra, selecting the spec- trum showing the least decomposition for the main library when replicate spectra are available. Some eval- uators have argued that spectra exhibiting such effects, while of low quality, may be ofvalue for the users of the library whose instrument may also produce spectra for certain labile compounds with the same problems 298 AUSLOOS ET AL.

The erroneous structure on the left was redrawn to the correct structure on the right. Final Statistics From the archive of 175,510 spectra, 129,136 spectra of 107,886 compounds were selected for inclusion in NIST 98. This included 69,061 different CASRNs, 13,205 of which were associated with 21,250 replicate spectra. Replicate spectra without an assigned CASRN are not presently included. Of the 46,374 archival spectra excluded from the library, approximately 3094: were isotopically labeled, 47% were flagged for deletion (incorrect), and the rest were either marked as being of a quality too low for inclusion, or were redundant replicate or duplicate spectra. For each of the 13,205 compounds having replicates, a manual selection of the best spectrum was made. Peaks were deleted or otherwise edited in approxie mately 7% of spectra selected for inclusion, The mean and median number of peaks per spectrum was 93 and 78, respectively, significantly higher than correspond» ing values reported in 1991 [11] of 72 and 53. Approx, imately 2% of spectra have fewer than 10 peaks whereas 38% have more than 100 peaks, in contrast to the corresponding prior values of 3.5% and 23%, respec7 tively. Of the 62,235 spectra of different compounds in the main library of the previous version, 7929 do not appear the main NlST 98 library. Of these, 4541 were replaced by better quality spectra and spectra for 3388 com- pounds were deleted, including 1607 with CASRNs. Changes to the chemical name were made for 1860 compounds and CASRNs were added or revised for 5244 spectra. The significance of a compound can be roughly assessed by the presence of its CASRN in selective chemical indexes. Percentages of compounds in these indexes that are also in NlST 98 are given in Table 2 along with the percent change from the previous ver- sion. The two principal factors determining these former values are the fractions of compounds in each index that are volatile and their commercial availability. Nearly all volatile compounds in the EPA list are included as are nearly half of all commercially available compounds (the bulk of those remaining are involatile). On the other hand only 10% of compounds in the TSCA Inventory are represented, many being mixtures, in- volatile substances and exotic compounds. “Recall/reliability\" plots derived from match factors in library searching have been interpreted to provide information concerning the quality of a mass spectral library [16]. We have not performed such an analysis since we are unable to separate library quality from other factors that strongly influence these plots. For instance, inclusion of replicate spectra in the library (or even exact duplicate spectra) of compounds in the test set can significantly improve recall /reliability “perfor— mance” by increasing the number of correct answers J Am Soc Mass Spectrom I999, 11], 287499 [10], while having little effect on more widely used performance measures (position of the correct hit in the hit list) [17]. Similar effects can occur by selecting alternative methods for computing match factors [16, 18], We therefore feel that the most effective means of describing the quality of a library is, as presented here, to provide the criteria for including and editing spectra along with statistical measures of the spectra and of the distribution of compounds. Future Work A considerable amount of work remains to be done to further improve library quality. Six high priority areas are listed below: (1) Archive program: a networked data evaluation program has been developed to replace the existing archive editing program. This will provide access to the evaluation history of each spectrum and permit the entry of evaluator comments It is planned that these will be made available to interested users, perhaps through the Internet. (2) Fragmentation software: algorithms have been developed that identify the peaks in a spectrum that are consistent with fragmentation rules. This will be em- ployed both to find possible errors in the library and to assist in the evaluation of new spectra. (3) Substructure analysis: methods have been devel- oped for reliably identifying the presence and absence of certain chemical substructures from a spectrum by analyzing results of library searches [19]. Library entries where these predictions are inconsistent with the re- ported structure will be examined for errors. Other methods for substructure searching will also be applied to find groups of compounds expected to have similar spectra for further analysis (4) Acquisition of spectra of relevant compounds: a goal is to acquire spectra for as many compounds as possible that appear in the indexes in Table 2. Further, when such compounds are commercially available and are represented by just one spectrum, a replicate spec— trum will be sought. (5) Chemical nomenclature: attention will be given to the collection of chemical names attached to the spectra, and efforts will be initiated to provide CASRNS and systematic names for all compounds. (6) Review of spectra of salts and derivatives: all remaining of spectra still attributed to salts will be CRITICAL EVALUATION or MS LIBRARY 299 re-examined for the purpose of renaming and possibly editing their spectra. Derivatives will be linked to the CASRNs of their starting compounds References 1.

Authoritv Permitting Other than Full and_(_)_pen Competition The authority which permits restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than that required in FAR 8.405-2(3Xi) is FAR 8.405~6(b)—«1tems peculiar to one manufacturer. An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacture. A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer. 5. Rationale Justiﬂing Use of Cited Authorigl: (a) Background This procurement is for the continuation of development of CMPro soﬁwsre capabilities for NAVAJR The CMPro soﬁware tool has been in use by NAVAJR for management of TD? data and for Conﬁguration Management (CM) of NAVAIR product baselines for several years. A number of NAVAER enterprise supported instances of the CMPro soﬁware have been in use by NAVAIR activities, and this procurement would allow for the continued capability improvement necessary for TDP conﬁguration management within NAVAIR. There are currently Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) approved and supported instances of CM'Pro at Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) Southwest (FRCSW), FRC Southeast (FRCSE), and NAWC-Training Systems Development (Orlando, FL). PMA-205, PMA-299, and several other PMAs have their own instances of CMPro being used to manage Conﬁgluation Management processes and data for their programs. Each of these activities will beneﬁt ﬁ'orn the capabilities under development in this contract. This contract will continue capabilities development initiated in 2016 as part of the Joint Engineering Data Management Information and Control System (JEDMICS) Modernization effort. (b) Justiﬁcation/Demonstration of PSA’s Unique Qualifications to Provide the Required Supplies and Services CMPro is an enterprise class Conﬁguration Management (CM) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software application. CMPro automates the process of managing product data, engineering data, inventory and conﬁguration data in a centralized integrated data environment CMPro is also one of the systems thatmake up the Automated Logistics Environment (ALE) Program of Record (FOR) for NAVAIR. With Conﬁguration Management and Product Lifecycle Management as core capabilities, CMPro resides within the CM/PLM/PDM Commodity Line. CMPm’s incllimion within the ALE FOR is in-sync with the OPNAV N41 / IT EXCOMM long tenn matey for CM/PLM systems. As the ALE POR and IT EXCOMM reviews and assesses requirements foranear term (15 year) approach and solution to 2 l&A_l9-203 the growing PLM needs of the NAE, the CMPro system has emerged as the leading tool which can meet the PLM needs of both the acquisition and sustainment communities. The Commodity Line Manager for CM /PLMIPDM has indicated that CMPro is expected to remain in the portfolio for the long term, and is being looked atto assist with on-going portfolio reduction efforts. CMPro is commercial ofﬂthe~shelf (COTS) soﬁware developed by PSA, Inc. No vendors other than PSA and its authorized resellers can provide the CMPro soﬁware and only PSA can provide the support required to customize CMPro to meet this speciﬁc Government requirement. CMPro was acquired by the Automated Test Equipment (ATE) program in order to manage the conﬁguration and product lifecycle of ATE systems supported by FRCSW. As FRCSW became aware of CMPm’s capabilities, command leadership turned to the CMPro system to ﬁll speciﬁc gaps in workﬂow capability, small scale agile development, and special purpose IT development efforts. The system was acquired by the ATE, program in order to manage the conﬁguration and product lifecycle of ATE systems supported by F RCSW. Development of unique NAVAIR TDP management processes and data structures within CMPro began in 2016 and have oontinuedto date. This continued effort is required to deliver a complete TDP acquisition through system sustainment capability compatible with NAVAIR TDP and Conﬁguration Management workﬂows and data requirements. Completion of this development effort will allow integrated data ﬂows between CMPro and NAVAIR Automated Logistics Enterprise PLM applications. Integration eﬂ'orts will be accomplished using the two six-month option periods to be included in this order. No other IT system in use by NAVAIR or COMFRC has the same integrated CM/PLM capabilities as CMPro. With that in mind, currently, there are no plans to migrate the core CM/PLM capabilities ofCMPro, or the special purpose modules developed around those core capabilities, to any other system. ' Estimated costs for implementing equivalent capabilities with another software tool is estimated at to —based on costs relating to both schedule and labor required to terminate this development in CMPro and initiate a similar development project using another commercial PLM software product. There are no similar or compatible development efforts underway at NAVAIR so to terminate this development and start over with developing a different software tool would result in a one to two-year delay in deployment which would be unacceptable to meet the ﬂeet requirements. AIR-6.8.5 will be required to initiate a new contract with one of several PLM soﬁware vendors and begin rte-development of TDP requirements in another software tool, re—procure licenses for the software, and begin new collaborative efforts with 7.2 and 6.8.4 to get the software approved and installed within the NMCI enclave. As 'such, these estimated cost and impact to schedule would not he recouped through competition. If a suitable alternative application could be identiﬁed, the required tasks needed for the' migration of data from CMPro to another system, or systems, would take well over a year to complete. Data migration is a labor intensive, time consuming, and complex undertaking under J&A_19—203 V the best of circumstances. Additionally, thereare costs associated with data migration that are over and above normal sustainment. 6. Market Research: Market Research for this particular order was not conducted among schedule holders because only CMPro, developed by PSA, Inc. can provide the required product or services. Market research for suitable CM/PLM soﬂware was done over a decade ago, and the software has been in continued use at NAVAIR for over 17 years. The requirements for capabilities were competed before CMPro was initially selected. Since that time, NAVAlR has been using this soﬁware tool because of its compatibility with NMCI, capability to meet requirements and also the low cost investment in terms of licensing and development support. Signiﬁcant cost and rework would be required to implement a new software solution with severe negative impact to users currently using the soﬁwarc for CM of their systems product baselines. No other IT system in use by NAVAIR or COMFRC has the same integrated CMIPLM capabilities as CMPro. A synopsis was not published in FEDBIZOPS in accordance with FAR 8.40401). Ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement. 7. Detennjngjon That the Order gggmsents the Best Value to Meet Ggygmm ent Needs; This order will be issued in accordance with FAR 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules. GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and ﬁxed price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by FAR 8.405-2(d). Although, GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing, this determination does not relieve the ordering activity contracting oﬁicor from the responsibility of considering the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform a speciﬁc task being ordered, and for determining that the total price is reasonable, using the proposal analysis techniques at 15.404-1. In accordance with FAR 8.4054, the ordering activity shall seek a price reduction when the order exceeds the simpliﬁed acquisition threshold before placing an order. The ordering activity has determined that placing an order against the GSA schedule represents the best value (considering price, special fwtures, administrative costs, etc.) consistent with 8.404(d) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative to meet Government needs. 8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition: This order is a follow-on development effort undertaken at signiﬁcantly less cost than NAVAIR could achieve by procuring and modifying alternate software packages that are advertised as equivalent but would require signiﬁcant customization and development in order to accomplish similar capabilities and integration as NAVAIR amend}! has with CMPro. Functional speciﬁcations, workﬂow definitions and data struchrre requirements were completed in previous 4 J&A_1 9—203 efforts beginning in 2016 and continued to date. If ﬁxture market research indicates a suitable alternative for integrated CM/PLM capabilities that ﬁt inn) the NAVAIR and COMFRC IT system, the requirement will be competed accordingly. 1&A_l 9-203 CERTIFICATIONS AND APPROVAL TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justiﬁcation and its supporting acquisition planning documents, except as noted herein are complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belieﬁ REQUIREMENTS COGNIZANCE: Signature Name (Printed) Phone No. Date LEGAL SUFFICIENCY REVIEW I have determined this justification is legally sufficient.
